<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day
whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into
bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the
white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth
like tiny, belated snowfalls.  Already the rays of the
setting sun were gilding the open space on the top of
the mountain where ridge-road and turnpike meet.
The ridge-road was only one of the little mountain
by-ways that wind through woods and up and down
dale as the necessities of the mountain people wear
them; the turnpike was an ancient artery connecting
North and South, threading cities and villages and
farms along its length like trophies on a chain.  The
shy windings of the mountain road knew nothing
more modern than the doctor's vehicle drawn by
White Rosy, nothing more exciting than the little
companies of armed, silent men who tramped over it
by night, or crossed it stealthily by day; but along the
pike coaches and motor cars pounded and rolled, and
a generation or so earlier an army had swung northward
over it in pride and hope and eagerness, to drift
southward again, a few days later, with only pride
left.  If, after that, the part of the old road that led
from the plain up to the higher valley seemed to lie
in a torpor, as if stunned by the agony of that retreat,
none the less it remained one of the strong warp
threads in Fate's fabric.
</p>

<p>
Yet Destiny chooses her own disguises.  A sick
baby had kept John Ogilvie on a sleepless vigil in the
backwoods for the past fifty hours; and it was not the
view from the crossroads, nor the doctor's habit of
drawing rein to look out upon it for a moment or two,
that made old Rosy stop there on this spring afternoon.
It was nothing more than a particularly luscious
patch of green by the roadside, and the consciousness
of her long climb having earned such a reward.
Rosy was an animal of experience and judgment, well
accustomed to the ways of her master, knowing as
well as he the houses where he stopped, capable of
taking him home unguided from anywhere, as she
would take him home this afternoon in her own good
time.  She had come thus far unguided; for when the
sick child's even breathing told the success of his
efforts, John Ogilvie had almost stumbled out of the
cabin and into his buggy, to fall asleep before he could
do more than say,
</p>

<p>
"Home, old lady!"
</p>

<p>
So Rosy had ambled homeward, knowing every
turn of the road, while the tired man slept on.
</p>

<p>
The open place where the roads crossed was a
famous "look-out."  Following its own level, the eye
of an observer first beheld the tops of other mountains
at all points of the horizon save one; at this season
the great masses were all misty green, except for
occasional patches of the dark of pines, or the white
gleam of dogwood, or rusty cleared spaces of
pastures; the highroad, on its way to the nearer valley,
at first dropped too abruptly to be seen, but
reappeared later as a pale white filament gleaming here
and there through the trees or winding past farmhouses
or fields tenderly green with young wheat.
Through the gap where the mountains broke apart a
great plain stretched, a plain once drenched with the
life of men, now gleaming in the rays of a sun already
sunk too low to reach over the nearer mountains.  All
human habitations lay so far below the crossroads
that no sound of man's activities ever arose to its
height; of wild life there was sound enough, to ears
attuned to it&mdash;mostly chattering of woodchucks and
song of birds, enriched at this season with the melody
of passing voyagers from the south.  Yet none of
these would have aroused the tired sleeper in the
buggy.  A far different sound came up through the
forest, and Ogilvie was awake on the instant, with
the complete consciousness of the man accustomed to
sudden calls.
</p>

<p>
He looked down at the purpling valley, across
through the gap to the gleaming plain, and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Rosy, couldn't you take me home till I
admired the view?" he asked; and by way of
answer the old white mare turned her head to look at
him, her mouth comfortably filled with young grass.
The doctor laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see!" he said.  "A case of afternoon
tea, was it, and not of admiring the view?  Well,
let's get along home now."
</p>

<p>
He looked across the valley to the mountain westward
of the gap; its form was that of a large crouching
panther, and high up on its shoulder a light
twinkled against the shadow.
</p>

<p>
"Come along!  Mother Cary's already lighted
her lamp!" the doctor said.  "There's bed ahead of
us, old girl, bed for me and oats for you!  Bed, Rosy!
Think of it!  And may Heaven grant good health
to all our friends this night!"
</p>

<p>
He drew up the reins as he spoke, and with a farewell
reach at a luscious maple leaf Rosy turned into
the pike.
</p>

<p>
But again there echoed through the woods the
unaccustomed sound that had aroused the doctor.  This
time it was too near to be mistaken; not even White
Rosy's calm could ignore it.
</p>

<p>
"Hel&mdash;lo!" said Ogilvie.  "A big horn and
a noiseless car!  Pretty early in the season for
those fellows.  Make way for your betters, White
Rosy!"
</p>

<p>
He drew well into the green of the roadside; for,
highway and turnpike though it was, the road was
narrow enough in this unfrequented part to make
passing a matter of calculation.  The driver of the
automobile had evidently discovered that for himself,
for he was climbing slowly and carefully, sounding
his horn as frequently as if driving through a
village.  As the car came out upon the cleared space
of the crossroads, Ogilvie turned, with the frank
interest of the country dweller in the passer-by, and
with the countryman's etiquette of the road waved
to its solitary occupant.
</p>

<p>
The driver of the car returned the greeting, drew
slowly forward, and stopped beside the doctor's old
buggy.  Ogilvie was not so much of a countryman
as not to recognize in the machine's powerful outlines
the costly French racer.  But that was only another
of Destiny's disguises.  The two men met on the
mountain-top, took cognizance of each other in
that high solitude where the things of the world lay
below them; and, face to face, each measured the
other and insensibly recognized his worth of
character.  Both knew men; both had been trained to the
necessity of forming quick judgments.  Before they
had exchanged a word they were sure of each other;
before the hour was out their friendship was as
certain as if it were years old.
</p>

<p>
The occupant of the car had a smile which was
apt to be grimly humorous, as Ogilvie noted in the
moment before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'm lost!" the stranger said, as if admitting
a joke on himself.  "I've come around in a circle
twice, looking for a place called Bluemont Summit,
and I've sounded my horn right along, hoping
somebody would run out to look, somebody I could ask
my way of.  But you're the first person I've seen
this afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie laughed aloud.  "No wonder, if you've
been blowing your horn all the way," he said.  "If
you had kept still, you might have come on someone
unawares; but nobody around here would run out
to look at you in the open."
</p>

<p>
"Is there anyone to run?" the other asked,
again with the grim twist of his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but they are shy, and too proud to seem
curious.  There may be eyes on us now, peeping
through those woods," said Ogilvie.  "But you're
not far from the Summit, not far, that is, with that
car of yours.  This is the Battlesburg Road, and
you're ten miles or so to the northwest of Bluemont."
</p>

<p>
The driver of the car had stepped down into
the road to do something to his lamps; it was
already so dark that their gleam shot far ahead.  White
Rosy eyed them dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"Only ten miles!  Jove, I'm glad of that!
Mountain air does whet a man's appetite!  The High
Court is the best hotel, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie looked at the other for a moment or
two before answering: looked, indeed, until the
stranger glanced questioningly up at him, as if
wondering at the delay.  Then he said:
</p>

<p>
"My name's Ogilvie, and I'm the doctor around
here.  I wish you'd let me prescribe a hot meal
at my house for you.  It's this side of the Summit."
</p>

<p>
The other man's smile had lost its grimness.
"That's mighty good of you," he said.  "And you
won't have to coat that dose with sugar!"
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," the doctor went on, "if you'd play
host first, and give me a lift?  I'm as hungry as you
are, and White Rosy here likes to choose her own
gait.  If you'll take me home, we'll be at my house
in one tenth the time, and Rosy can find her way
alone.  She's done it many a time."
</p>

<p>
The other man looked at the old mare, and as he
answered stroked her nose and gave her shoulder a
friendly smack or two.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I'll give you a lift," he said.  "Good
of you to suggest it.  This old lady looks as if she
knew as much as most of us.  I hope you won't hurt
her feelings by deserting her!"
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie had come down to the road, and already
deposited his black bags and his old brown cap in
the automobile; now he was busy unbuckling Rosy's
reins.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," he said.  "She'll come home
all the quicker for not having me on her mind!  It's
home and oats, Rosy, oats, remember," he said as he
got up into the automobile with the reins in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Flood&mdash;Benson Flood, and I've
been down in Virginia buying a little old farm for
the shooting they tell me the neighborhood's good
for.  I never use road maps&mdash;like to discover things
for myself.  That's how I got lost to-day."
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie, leaning back, could inspect the face of
the man beside him.  Involuntarily, his expression
had slightly changed at the name.  Benson Flood was
as well known to readers of the daily papers as Hecla
or Klondike or Standard Oil, and stood for about
the same thing&mdash;wealth, spectacular wealth.  The
name had heretofore interested John Ogilvie neither
more nor less than any of the others; now, sitting
beside its possessor, it carried a different and more
personal significance.  It seemed almost grotesquely
unreal that an actual living person, a man to be met
at a mountain crossroads, could calmly introduce
himself as Benson Flood, and be as frankly and
comfortably hungry as anyone else.  These thoughts,
however, took but an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've seen a bit of country, anyway,"
he replied, quite as if his mind were not busy on its
separate line of speculation.  Flood's face was not
what he would have expected to find it.  It had not
lost its lean ruggedness, nor put on those fleshly
signs of indulgence that are so apt to follow the early
acquisition of great wealth.  The well-cut mouth was
very firm, and there was something of the idealist,
the questioner, the seeker of high things, about the
eyes and brow that Ogilvie found puzzling and
interesting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and what a view there was from that
crossroads up there!  I wish I could transplant my
Virginia farm to that mountain-top.
</p>

<p>
"A good many men have seen that view; the
army retreated from Battlesburg along this old pike,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Battlesburg!  I'm from the West, where
history is not much more than we fellows have made
it; it fairly stirs my blood to come across a place like
Battlesburg, with its monuments, and its memories,
and where Lincoln spoke, and all that.  I'm going to
run up there to-morrow, if the hotel people can set
me on my way early enough."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you'll have to trust me to do that,"
said Ogilvie.  "There's my house, there where the
light's in the front porch; and&mdash;I hope you won't
think I've kidnapped you, but I'm going to keep you
over night.  The hotels aren't open at this time of
year."
</p>

<p>
As the car stopped before the doctor's cottage,
Flood turned to his host.  "Oh, I say!  That's
mighty good of you!  Won't I put you out?  Isn't
there some place I can go to?"
</p>

<p>
But Ogilvie laughed.  "There is not, but I
wouldn't tell you if there was!  Why, Mr. Flood, I
haven't talked to anyone from beyond the mountains
for six months!"
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
Spring, that stole upon the mountains with an
evanescent fragrance, and unfolding of delicate
greens and shy opening blossoms, swept into the city
with a blaze of life and color, with a joyous
outpouring of people and bedizening of shop-windows; and
nowhere else was its influence so marked as on the
Avenue.  Motor vehicles crowded from curb to curb,
held back or permitted to sweep onward by the
uplifted hands of mighty creatures in uniform,
horseback and afoot, imperturbably calm, lords and rulers
and receivers of tribute; the sidewalks swarmed with
people, lines of men and women swinging northward
and southward, some buoyantly conscious of
new-fashioned raiment, their eyes apparently unaware of
the jostling crowd, some with tiny dogs under their
arms, some looking at the passing faces, or bowing
to people in motor cars, a few glancing into the
brilliant windows of the shops, a few chatting and
laughing with companions.
</p>

<p>
Benson Flood, returned from Virginia the day
before, was one of those who, marching northward,
looked searchingly into the faces of the people he
passed, and frequently glanced into the automobiles
on his right.  No one in all that army was more
aware than he of the vivid beauty of the moving
scene.  For three years he had watched the Avenue
burst into life and color under the recurring influence
of Spring; but he had lost none of the keenness
of his first perception of it, none of his delight in its
unique splendor, none of the thrill of having achieved
the right to be a part of it.
</p>

<p>
Achievement, indeed, was what Benson Flood
stood for.  Beginning life in a Western town, his
subsequent history was one of those spectacular
dramas common enough in American progress, yet
always thrilling in their exhibition of daring and
courage, in their apparent forcing of opportunity,
their making and taking of chances, their final
conquest of power and wealth.  Flood's career differed
from many another only in two particulars: as early
as the age of forty he had reached that point where
he could afford to lay aside his more public pursuits;
and at the same time, perhaps because he had grown
no older in the cult, the mere accumulation of wealth
ceased to be the first object in life for him.  He was
the offspring of one of the curious mixtures of race
that distinguish America; and doubtless from some
ancestor of an older civilization he inherited a taste
and longing for that to which, in his youth and early
manhood, he had been an absolute stranger.  When
he left his West behind him, he faced towards those
gentler things which, in his fine imagination and the
perception trained by the exigencies of his career, he
felt to be more desirable than anything he had yet
attained to.  Certainly they had become to him,
untasted though they were at the time, of greater
importance.  He valued his experiences, his labors, his
millions; but they were not enough.  However
unaccustomed to it he might be, he knew very definitely
what he now wanted; and a winter in New York,
with a year or two in Europe, had put him in a fair
way of adding the fulfillment of his later ambition to
his earlier achievements.  A race-winning yacht, a few
introductions among people who welcome the owners
of mines and large fortunes, these gave a social
background which, with the excellent foundation of his
millions, served very well in New York, and taught
him much about those things which he was now so
sure of wanting.  It was not strange that he believed
them to be summed up, embodied, realized to the
utmost, in one woman.
</p>

<p>
He was looking for her as he walked up the Avenue
on this April afternoon; she loved its life and
color and change, and was apt to pass over some part
of it as often as she could.  So Flood watched the
passing women for the face that could so magically
quicken his pulses.  Many sought his recognition, yet
he was oblivious of their number, ignoring the
various half-invitations that were tentatively made
him&mdash;the leaning forward of one in a limousine, the
slight pause or lingering look of another.
</p>

<p>
His thoughts were still full of his journey, and
Spring on the Avenue only brought up memories&mdash;so
lately realities&mdash;of the breath of the woods, the
wind in the tree-tops, the brown and green of fields
so lately seen; and Flood had reached that state of
mind where all that was sweet in memory, all that
was beautiful in the present, all that he desired from
the future, only reminded him of the one woman.
</p>

<p>
Several times, through the crowd, he thought he
saw her, and went more quickly forward; but as often
he fell back, disappointed.  Suddenly, in answer to
a firm grasp on his arm, he turned.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Marshall!" he said, not too enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Benny, is it a wager?  You're stalking
up the Avenue without a word or a look for
anybody, trampling on people, mowing them down by
the thousand like a Juggernaut from the West!
That's how I traced you, by the bodies strewn in your
path."
</p>

<p>
Flood was always amused by Pendleton's nonsense;
yet now he smiled and said nothing.  To-day
it was not Pendleton he wanted to see.  The other
seemed to divine this.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem very sociable," he remarked.
"Did your lone trip to Virginia give you a confirmed
taste for solitude?"
</p>

<p>
Again Flood smiled; he could no more resist
Pendleton's aimless chatter than a large dog can
resist the playfulness of a small one.  His side-long
glance had to go downwards to meet Marshall's.
</p>

<p>
"Quite the contrary," he said.  "I've bought
the old Gore place in Berkeley and now I want to fill
it up with guests.  I count on you to help me out,
Marshall."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are!  Come up to Mrs. Maxwell's
with me, and we'll get dear Cecilia to help us out,
too!"
</p>

<p>
Flood's face suddenly hardened a little.  It was
an unconscious trick of his under the stress of any
sudden emotion; in effect, it was as if a hand had
passed over his features, leaving them expressionless.
Many a game had he won, mastered many a situation,
by means of it.
</p>

<p>
He paused perceptibly before he answered Pendleton.
Then he said, "I shall have to leave that to you!"
</p>

<p>
"You're too modest, Benny," Pendleton said,
shaking his head.  "Remember your taxes, man, not
to mention your bank account, and don't let dear
Cecilia awe you."
</p>

<p>
It was presently made evident enough that the
dear Cecilia in question held nothing of awe for
Pendleton himself; for they were no sooner in the rather
austere little drawing room than he bent over
Mrs. Maxwell, and, quite deliberately ignoring the five or
six earlier comers, whispered in her ear:
</p>

<p>
"Get rid of the crowd, Cecilia; we've great
news for you!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell was apparently oblivious of his
whisper, for she made herself more charming than
ever to the other men; yet presently, almost before
Flood was aware of it, the others were gone, and she
was saying:
</p>

<p>
"Well, Marshall?  You always bring your little
budget with you, don't you?  What is it now?"
</p>

<p>
"If you're going to be, nasty, Cecilia, I won't tell
you!"
</p>

<p>
Flood, who had not so far progressed as to
become accustomed to such badinage, looked uneasily
from Pendleton to their hostess; but Mrs. Maxwell
seated herself beside him on the sofa, and calmly
smiled.
</p>

<p>
Apparently she was going to ignore Pendleton
for the moment.  "I am always so glad when I can
have my tea comfortably, without having to look
after a roomful of people," she said.  "You don't
take it, I know, Mr. Flood, and Marshall can look
out for himself.  What do you think of this pink
lustre cup, Mr. Flood?  It's Rosamund's latest
acquisition."
</p>

<p>
Flood had, after all, learned much in his three
years.  He bent forward to examine the cup, while
Mrs. Maxwell turned its iridescent beauty towards
the light.
</p>

<p>
"It is adorable," he said.  "Is Miss Randall
hunting for more to-day?"
</p>

<p>
Again his face had quickly become expressionless,
but neither of the others were aware of it, and
his question was doomed to remain unanswered.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton could no longer withhold his news.
"Benny's just back from Virginia, Cecilia," he said.
"He's bought Oakleigh."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's West Virginia, and it's just a little
farm, you know," Flood said, weakly; but his
geography was entirely immaterial to the others.
</p>

<p>
"Oakleigh?  The Gore place?"
</p>

<p>
Flood still found it amazing that so many people
knew so many other people; his lately made
acquaintances in New York always seemed to know all
about his lately made acquaintances in Florida or
Virginia or the Berkshires, or, for that matter, in
Europe.  It was another of the things to which he
had not yet become accustomed.
</p>

<p>
"And he wants you and me to help him fill it
up with people," Pendleton went on, with the
frankness for which he was famous.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell looked quickly over her tea-cup at
Flood, raising her eyebrows ever so slightly.  For
once Flood could not control his expression; his face
flushed deeply as he leaned towards her.
</p>

<p>
"If you only would!" he begged.  "I thought&mdash;I
scarcely dared to hope&mdash;that perhaps if&mdash;if
Miss Randall came along, too, you might consent to
play hostess for a lone man?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was a practiced campaigner, as she had
had need to be during the dreary years before she
had Rosamund's money to count upon; instantly she
recalled the place Flood could afford to call a "little
farm," Oakleigh, white-pillared and stately, with its
kennels and stables and conservatories.  She could
not imagine why he had chosen her unless it were
thanks to Pendleton; yet, to be hostess of Oakleigh,
even for a week or two, distinctly appealed to her.
It would be possible enough, if she were to go as
Rosamund's chaperon.  Even Flood had seen that;
and if it were left to her to fill its rooms with guests,
how many debts might she not cancel!  The opportunity
was wonderful, a gift from Heaven; but could
she count upon Rosamund?  Would Rosamund go?
There was a lack of complacency in Rosamund that
her sister frequently found trying; she wondered how
far she might dare to commit her to accepting
Flood's invitation.  Yet daring and Cecilia were not
strangers, and the opportunity was unique.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure of Rosamund's dates," she said.
</p>

<p>
Flood hesitated; but Pendleton, too, had been
thinking about the splendor of Oakleigh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but Benny has no dates for Oakleigh yet!"
he said.  "So you may set your own time, Cecilia.
Isn't that so, Benny?"
</p>

<p>
"If you only will," Flood besought her.
</p>

<p>
After all, Cecilia thought, there was nothing
Rosamund could do, if she definitely promised for
her!
</p>

<p>
"Then I think June will be quite perfect," she
said, and said it none too soon; for the door was
suddenly framing the vision of Flood's desire.
</p>

<p>
For an instant she seemed almost to sway in the
doorway, as if she had come to the utmost limit of
strength; she was paler than he had ever seen her,
and, he thought, more lovely.  He could never
behold her without an immediate sense of abasement.
Her beauty was of that indefinable sort which touches
the heart and imagination rather than storms the
senses.  Men did not look upon her as at some
beautiful creature on exhibition; always they looked, to
be sure, but straightway the masculine appraisement
of their gaze changed to the look one bestows upon
some high and lovely thing.  Her face had that
fullness through the temples that Murillo loved; her
eyes, hazel or brown or gray, changing in color with
the responsive widening of the pupils, were rather
far apart, deeply set, warm with interest when she
looked directly at you; dark hair, ruddily brown, that
broke into curl whenever a strand escaped, framed
her face closely, and was always worn more simply
than fashion demanded.  She was tall enough to play
a man's games well, and the impression that she gave
was one of vigor and alertness, almost of impatience.
This was the first time Flood had seen her tired.
</p>

<p>
And, as always when he saw her, it swept over
him that she was, alone and above all others, the
woman he wanted.  She was beautiful, but it was not
her beauty, not her social eminence, certainly not her
wealth, nor anything that she might be said to
represent, that constituted her appeal for him.  There
was that in her which he had not met elsewhere in
his countrywomen, though frequently enough in
France and England, a simplicity, a calmness, a
dignity, which he interpreted as a consciousness that she
needed no pretense, no further struggle or ambition
to be other than just what she was.  And what she
was, was what he very much wanted.  For him, she
was the bright sum of all desire, the embodiment of
everything rare and fine, which he now craved all
the more because they had been denied him in his
earlier years.  Months before, since the first time he
saw her, he had known that, and accepted it as an
inspiration, as he had accepted and lived upon the fine
flashes of imagination that had led him on to
fortune in those western days, when imagination and
courage had been his stock in trade; it was only the
ultimate, and by far the most important, of those!
</p>

<p>
But Miss Randall was certainly unaware that she
aroused in anyone in her drawing-room stronger
feelings than the mild ones which usually accompany
afternoon tea.  After an instant's survey from the
doorway, she came into the room, trying to smile
through her fatigue.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, Rosamund!  You look like a ghost!
Have you been walking yourself to death again?"
her sister asked.
</p>

<p>
Flood's greeting was only a silent bow and a
touch of her offered hand, but Pendleton was never
speechless.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Rose," he cried, "Flood's just been
inviting us all down to Virginia for June, and dear
Cecilia has accepted!  Can you stand the joy of
having me to talk to for a whole month, Rosamund?"
</p>

<p>
At a quick spark in her sister's eyes, Cecilia bent
towards her and spoke somewhat hastily.  "Mr. Flood
has bought Oakleigh, the Gore place.  Isn't
it nice of him to ask us down there, first of all?"
</p>

<p>
Although to her sister her look seemed to hold
many things, to Flood's infatuated eyes the girl
seemed suddenly more tired, harassed, or troubled;
and with another of his flashes of intuition he would
not give her a chance to reply.  He began to tell
them about his lone journey, talking very well, quite
sure of his facts and with a large enthusiasm, and in
spite of herself Rosamund became more and more
interested.  She even smiled a little at his account of
the mountain doctor's old mare and her wisdom; she
even found herself willing to hear more about the
doctor!
</p>

<p>
"But, I assure you," Flood went on, "it wouldn't
have taken anyone long to discover that he was not
the usual country doctor.  There is something about
the man that would attract the attention of the world,
if he lived on a pillar or were buried beneath the
sands of Arizona.  Personality, I suppose, unless
you're willing to look the fact in the face and admit
that a certain force emanates from greatness, wherever&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, say!" Pendleton protested; and Flood
laughed, rather shamefacedly, as a man laughs when
he is discovered reading a learned book or quoting a
classic.
</p>

<p>
But Miss Randall would not have that.  "Please
don't mind him, Mr. Flood; I want to hear the rest
of it."
</p>

<p>
Again Flood was taken unawares, and his face
flushed; but he went on to describe the evening
before the doctor's fire, the four days he had remained,
a willing guest, the drives about the mountains in
the doctor's buggy&mdash;lest his own car should startle
the shy mountain people.
</p>

<p>
"And since I've got back, I've been finding out
about him.  You know how it is&mdash;meet a chap you
never heard of before, and straightway find out that
a dozen people you know have known him for years.
</p>

<p>
"Last night I met Doctor Hiram Wilson in the
club; he said it was the first time he'd had a chance
to run in for months, yet he happened to be the first
man I saw there.  I was telling him something about
this chap, and found he knew all about him.  'Keenest
young investigator I ever knew,' he said, 'and
came near working himself to death.  How is he
now?'  He seemed mighty glad when I told him I
could not have suspected that Ogilvie had ever been
ill.  Then he called Professor Grayson over, to
repeat what I'd just told him; and I wish you could
have seen old Grayson's face.  He was delighted, but
he could really tell more about Ogilvie than I could.
It seems that Ogilvie was under him for a time, but
had really gone far beyond him; then he made
himself ill by working day and night in his laboratory,
and some of his medical friends packed him off to
those mountains to get well.  He was too far gone to
protest, I guess; but before he was well enough to
come back, he was so interested in the people there
that he was willing to stay.  Now the big fellows
have fallen into the way of sending patients down
to Bluemont, in the summer, to be near him; and he
consults everywhere all over the country.  They told
me last night that his investigations and experiments
on the nervous system would do more to save the
vision than&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Miss Randall, at the word, exclaimed, and
with parted lips and brightening eyes leaned towards
him.  Flood stopped, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Vision!  His work is for vision?  For the
eyes?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"His experimental work.  Of course, in the
mountains&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Maxwell was tired of Flood's enthusiasm.
"Dear me!  She is going to tell him about
Eleanor!  Take pity on me, Marshall, and help me
to escape!" she exclaimed, jumping up.
</p>

<p>
But her sister was far too deeply interested to be
aware of their withdrawing towards the window.
"Oh, Mr. Flood, is he really successful?  Can he
really help?"
</p>

<p>
"I am told, and I believe, that he is a great man,
Miss Randall.  But surely&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For the first time the weary look had left her
face.  "Mr. Flood, if you can help me!  I have a
friend, the dearest friend I have in the world, who
believes she is going to be blind.  I don't believe it!
I will not!  And yet, it would not be remarkable&mdash;she
has been through so much, so much!  Oh, I cannot
bear to think of it!"
</p>

<p>
Her hands were clasped on her knees, and she
bent her head over them to hide the tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You have been with her this afternoon?"
Flood surmised.
</p>

<p>
"We have spent the afternoon at an oculist's,"
she said.  "I have begged her for weeks, for weeks,
to let me take her&mdash;but she is so proud, oh, so
foolishly proud&mdash;and to-day&mdash;to-day&mdash;Oh, it is
unbearably cruel!"
</p>

<p>
She arose, and stood half turned from him, to
hide her emotion, swaying a little; and intensely as
he had wanted many things, Flood had never wanted
anything so keenly as to comfort her&mdash;to comfort
her by taking her in his arms, if he could, but above
all, by any means, to comfort her.  Hitherto it had
seemed impossible, in his modesty, to make her
realize his existence apart from the multitude; he
welcomed this heaven-sent opportunity.  Quite suddenly,
in his need, he found his faith in Ogilvie increased
a hundredfold; but he was too much concerned to
perceive the humor of it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but&mdash;" he cried, "but I should never in
the world accept one man's opinion as final!  And
I assure you, Ogilvie is called in consultation by
Blake, Wilson, Whitred.  I should certainly have
her see him!"
</p>

<p>
She seated herself again, wearily.  "Ah, she is
so proud!  It is only when she sees I am fairly breaking
my heart over her that she will let me do anything."
</p>

<p>
"Then she is not&mdash;she has not&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as for what she has and what she is, those
are quite two different things, Mr. Flood!  She is
the dearest and loveliest and bravest creature in the
world.  She is more than I could possibly tell you.
I have adored her ever since she was one of the big
girls in the school where I was a tiny one.  My
father and mother were abroad, and Cecilia was up
here in the North, with her father's people, and then
married; and I was left in Georgia at school, oh, such
a lonely little mite!  Eleanor was everything in the
world to me&mdash;big sister, little mother,
friend&mdash;everything!  Then she married, and my father died
abroad and dear Mamma took me over with her.
Eleanor and I wrote to each other, and I was
godmother for her little boy; but Mamma and I were in
France until&mdash;until Mamma died, three years ago;
and it was only last year, when I came to live with
Cecilia, that I found my Eleanor again."
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously she was revealing to Flood more
of her life than he had known before; he was afraid
to interrupt by so much as a question.  His face had
again taken on the expressionless mask which so well
covered his emotion or interest.
</p>

<p>
"I had never realized it, Mr. Flood; but all the
while I was having everything, my precious Eleanor
was poor, very poor.  She had no relatives near
enough to count, and her guardian sent her to school
with what little money she had.  I'm afraid it did
not teach her very well how to support herself!  She
married the year she left school; she has never spoken
of him at all, but I don't believe her husband
was&mdash;was all she had believed.  When he died, she brought
little Bob to New York.
</p>

<p>
"I heard dear old Mrs. Harley say, only a day
or two ago, that there are thousands of Southern
girls, dear, sweet girls who have never done any
work at all, who come to New York every year to
try to earn a living.  Sometimes they think they can
sing, sometimes they want to become artists,
sometimes they just come; and Eleanor was one of them.
Only, with her, it was worse, for she had Bob.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how they got along.  I was in
Europe, and she would only write when I had sent
Bob something.  I never dreamed that people,
people of my own sort, my own friends even, might be
hungry, and not have money enough to buy
anything to eat."
</p>

<p>
"You ought not to know it now," Flood said.
But she only shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I believe Eleanor has been hungry.  And if you
could only see her&mdash;she is so lovely, as lovely as a
white lily!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but surely, Miss Randall, she could have
got help!  There are no end of places&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But a woman like Eleanor can't seek just
any kind of help, you know, and&mdash;well, as darling
Mrs. Harley says, charity doesn't help much, when
it is only charity.  Even from me, Eleanor says she
cannot.
</p>

<p>
"When I came to New York to live with Cecilia,
I went at once to see her.  She let me do all I
could for little Bob, but it was too late.  He died.
And now she will not let me do anything for her.  I
ask her what good my money is to me, if she will not
let me use it as I want to!  She would not even let
me take her to an oculist until she saw that I was
just breaking my heart over her!  And now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Again her head was bent over her clasped hands;
again she was too moved, for the moment, to speak.
Flood seized his opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, it can be arranged," he said.  "You
have taken me into your confidence&mdash;you will let
me&mdash;advise, won't you?"  She looked up eagerly, and
he went quickly on.  "See your friend, Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Reeves."
</p>

<p>
"See your friend, Mrs. Reeves, and tell her about
Ogilvie.  Tell her that he is looking for someone&mdash;a
lady&mdash;to help with his work down in those mountains.
Prepare her to accept his offer.  I will
telegraph him."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him blankly.  "But&mdash;would it be
true?  I don't think I understand!"
</p>

<p>
He smiled reassuringly.  "It would not be true
that I am going to Europe to-morrow&mdash;but we could
make it true!  If we get her away from the city, and
near Ogilvie, we can leave everything else to him.
He's really a good deal of a man, you know."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund sprang to her feet.  "Cecilia," she
said, across the room, to her sister, "I am going
back to Eleanor's."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
In her enthusiasm at the chance of finding a way
out for Eleanor, Rosamund seemingly forgot that
it was Flood who helped her.  As a matter of fact, she
considered him so little that she was quite willing to
make use of his assistance in so good a cause and
then to ignore him.  She had always found someone
at hand to help her in anything she wanted to do;
she could not remember a time when there was not
someone ready and willing to gratify her least whim.
It was only in her efforts on Eleanor's behalf that
she was baffled for the first time, as much by Eleanor's
own pride as by not knowing to whom to turn, or
where help was to be found.  It was a new experience
for her to find that her money could do nothing;
for it was precisely her money that her cherished
Eleanor refused.  If she was to do anything, it must
be by some other means.
</p>

<p>
Flood was not as entirely unconscious of her attitude
as he appeared.  He had no intention of pressing
himself upon her through making himself of use.
He beheld her suffering in sympathy with this
unknown friend of hers, and her suffering so worked
upon his love for her that he would have done much
more to lessen it.  But he knew humanity; and while
he took more pleasure in being generous than in any
other of the powers his wealth had brought him, he
gave without thought of benefits returned, save in the
satisfaction of giving.
</p>

<p>
His first move was a letter to the mountain doctor.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
MY DEAR DR. OGILVIE: [he wrote] Since my
visit with you a matter has been brought to my attention
in which I do not hesitate to ask your assistance.
Two ladies whom I hold in highest esteem are in
great anxiety over a friend of theirs whom they have
known from childhood.  This friend is a widow who
has lately lost her son, having come to New York
from the South a few years ago in the hope of
supporting herself and the child, and being now alone
here except for the ladies who are my friends and
hers.  Her situation, you will perceive, is common
enough; but what adds to the distress in this instance
is that Mrs. Reeves' eyes are affected, to what extent
I do not know.  I have not had the pleasure of meeting
the lady myself; but I am told that her vision is
not entirely to be despaired of; and my friend Doctor
Hiram Wilson has great confidence in your power.
It would be impossible to offer charity to Mrs. Reeves;
and it would be equally impossible for her to
go to the Summit to be near you without assistance;
indeed, it has been impossible for her to consult an
oculist here until the entreaties of my friends
prevailed upon her to do so with them.  But it occurs
to me that you might find use for an assistant in your
work in the mountains&mdash;a capable lady who has
suffered enough to have sympathy with the sufferings of
others, and that sort of thing.  Now would you be
willing to lend yourself to a mild deception for the
sake of conferring a great benefit?  If you can make
use of Mrs. Reeves' assistance, I shall be very glad
to remit to you whatever remuneration you might
offer her.  I should also expect to pay the usual fees
for your attention to Mrs. Reeves' eyes.  You will
know best how to take up that matter with her, so as
not to arouse her suspicions of its having been
suggested to you.  I should suggest that you write to
me, asking whether I can advise you of a suitable
person to fill the office of&mdash;whatever is the medical
equivalent of parochial assistant.  I am sure I may
count upon your help; as I understand it, this is one
of those cases whose claim cannot be denied by any
one of us.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A few days later Flood went to Miss Randall
with Ogilvie's reply:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Curiously enough, I have the very place for
Mrs. Reeves.  One of my patients, who has taken a cottage
at the Summit for the summer, is looking for a
companion.  I am writing her by this mail to apply
through you to Mrs. Reeves.  We will see what we
can do for those troublesome eyes; but I can manage
it better if I don't have the haunting feeling that I
am to be paid&mdash;you will understand that.  Your
parochial assistant plan sounded very tempting, but
that sort of thing would be too good to be true.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Flood laughed when Rosamund looked up from
reading it.  "My friend Ogilvie seems to be as shy
of possible charity as your Mrs. Reeves," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she asked.  Then he
remembered that she could not know what he had
written.
</p>

<p>
She saw his hesitancy and laughed.  "Oh!  So
you've been offering charity, have you?  I wish you'd
let me see a copy of your letter!"
</p>

<p>
"Now what for?" he asked.  "Ogilvie's idea
beats mine."
</p>

<p>
"But I'd like to see your literary style," she said,
still laughing at him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please!" he protested.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think you are very good, Mr. Flood.
The rôle of rescuer of dames is very becoming to
you!  If you could see my Eleanor you'd feel
repaid.  She is the loveliest and the dearest&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I haven't done anything at all, I assure
you.  I'm sure I hope your friend will find this
Mrs. Hetherbee a comfortable person to live with."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Hetherbee!  Is that Doctor Ogilvie's patient?"
</p>

<p>
Flood nodded.  "She telephoned me before I'd
had my breakfast for Mrs. Reeves' address.  That
was my excuse for bothering you in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"You are good," she said.  Then she added, a
little ruefully, "I wish you could help me to break
the news to Eleanor!"
</p>

<p>
For to persuade her Eleanor, as she had foreseen,
was not as easy as to persuade Flood and the
unknown doctor and his patient.
</p>

<p>
She knew the lunch-room that Eleanor liked best,
and sought her there at the noon hour.  They chatted
across the small intervening table, until Eleanor
arose.
</p>

<p>
"You are not going back to the office," Rosamund
declared, when they were together on the street.
"Now, Eleanor, please don't be difficult!"
</p>

<p>
"My dearest child!" Mrs. Reeves began; but
Rosamund took her friend's arm through her own,
and poured forth the story of how she had heard,
through a Mr. Flood, that Mrs. Hetherbee wanted
a companion.
</p>

<p>
"Who is Mrs. Hetherbee?" Eleanor asked, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the least idea," Rosamund frankly
admitted.  "But she wants a companion, and she is
going to spend the summer at Bluemont Summit,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused, and Eleanor turned to her.  "Rose,
tell it all!" she said.  "You wouldn't be suggesting
my leaving one situation for another, unless you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I wouldn't!  I know it!  I confess!  I
am!  But you are so peculiar, Eleanor!"
</p>

<p>
They laughed together, and Rosamund took courage
to tell her.  "There is a man there who, they
say, does wonders for the eyes.  That is why I want
you to go, Eleanor.  I don't know what Mrs. Hetherbee
will pay you; and I will not offer to&mdash;to&mdash;I
will not offer anything at all!  But oh, Eleanor,
please, please go!"
</p>

<p>
They walked in silence to the vestibule of the
towering building where Eleanor worked.  At the
elevator she turned to Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
"I will go to see Mrs. Hetherbee to-night," she
said.  "And I do love you!"
</p>

<p>
Some weeks thereafter Rosamund came home
from bidding Mrs. Reeves farewell at the station, to
find Cecilia once more dispensing tea to Pendleton
and Flood; and she sent Flood into a state of
speechless happiness with her thanks.  Eleanor had
promised to see Doctor Ogilvie about her eyes at once,
and Mrs. Hetherbee had taken a tremendous fancy
to Eleanor, and it was good of Mr. Flood to have
sent those lovely flowers to the train.  Eleanor had
introduced her as a friend of Mr. Benson Flood, and
was he willing that she should shine in his reflected
glory?  Because it had tremendously impressed
Mrs. Hetherbee!
</p>

<p>
When the men had left, Cecilia turned to her
sister.  "He's in love with you, you know!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  I've known him all my life, Cissy,
and you don't fall in love with a person you've seen
spanked!"
</p>

<p>
"You know very well I'm not talking about Marshall,"
said Mrs. Maxwell.  "And you know very well
that Mr. Flood is tremendously in love with you."
</p>

<p>
"I think you're disgusting," said Rosamund.
"For heaven's sake, don't try to follow the fashion
of the women of our set in that respect, Cissy!  Every
man they know has to be in love with somebody&mdash;half
the time with somebody else's wife!  Oh, I
loathe it!"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia remained calm.  "I hope you don't loathe
Mr. Flood," she said, "because he is."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund threw herself back in a deep chair,
and looked at her sister in the exasperation one feels
towards the sweetly stubborn.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well!  He is!  But that's nothing to me!"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it?  He probably thinks it is!  You've
taken his help for your precious Eleanor, you know,
and you're going to Oakleigh next month."
</p>

<p>
"I am not going to do anything of the kind!"
</p>

<p>
That moved Cecilia.  "But my dear child, you
certainly are!  He has asked me to be hostess for
his first house-party, and I have accepted, and said
you'd go with me."
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia!"
</p>

<p>
"Now don't say you've forgotten it!  Why, it
was the very day you told him about Eleanor."
</p>

<p>
Cecilia remained provokingly silent; and Rosamund
jumped up impatiently, only to throw herself
down upon another chair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish I had never seen the man!" she
cried.  "I did tell him about Eleanor, and I did let
him do something for her.  I would have taken help
for Eleanor from anybody&mdash;from a street-sweeper,
or the furnace man!  That doesn't give your
Mr. Flood any claim on me!"
</p>

<p>
"Yours, dear!" said Cecilia, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"He is not!  Why, he is&mdash;nobody!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's not his fault.  He wants to be
somebody!  He is doing his best to marry into our
family, love!"
</p>

<p>
At that Rosamund had to laugh.  "Oh, Cissy!
Don't be such a goose!  Mr. Flood is perfectly
odious to me, and you know it.  I don't see why you
ever let Marshall introduce him!  I don't see why
you ever allowed him to so much as dare to invite us
to Oakleigh!"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear, Oakleigh is&mdash;Oakleigh!"
</p>

<p>
"What if it is?  He ought to have known better
than to ask us there, and I don't see why you
accepted."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell smiled.  "Pity, my dear!" she
explained.  "Pity&mdash;the crumb to a starving dog&mdash;the
farthing to a beggar!  Besides, he will let me
invite whom I please and&mdash;well, Benson Flood may
be a suppliant for one thing, Rose, but he has, after
all, more money than he can count!"
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you marry him yourself?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell shrugged.  "'Nobody asked me,
sir, she said!'  And besides, when poor dear Tommy
died&mdash;oh, well, he did actually die, poor darling, so
there never was any question of divorce or anything
horrid, like that&mdash;you know how old-fashioned I
am in my ideas, Rosamund!  But still, there is such
a thing as tempting Providence a little too often.  My
hopes are distinctly not matrimonial.  Not that I
think Mr. Flood is the least bit like Tommy.  If I
did, of course I couldn't conscientiously&mdash;you know!
As it is, I think he'd do very well&mdash;in the family!"
</p>

<p>
"You show great respect for the family!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Rosamund, the family can stand it!
You must admit that!  I am sure the Stanfields and
the Berkleys and the Randalls need not mind a&mdash;a&mdash;an
alliance with&mdash;with the millions of a Benson
Flood!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund sighed impatiently.  "Oh, dear, Cecilia,"
she said, "I do wish it were in my power to
give you half my money!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell smiled with pursed lips.  "So do
I," she declared.  "I'd take it in a minute!  But you
can't!  You can't do one single thing with it until
you're twenty-five, except spend the income; and
you've got six months more before your birthday.
And even then you won't want to give me half of it,
because now you don't even want me to spend the
income!  Gracious!  I wish I had a chance at it!"
</p>

<p>
"I do give you half of my income, Cecilia!"
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't," Mrs. Maxwell contradicted,
in a voice that echoed an old complaint.  "You only
give me half of the sum you think two people ought
to spend!  As if it isn't right and one's duty to spend
all one can!  I know there's something about keeping
money in circulation, and all that, if only I could
remember it!  But nothing would move you!  Poor
dear Mamma used to say that Colonel Randall was
obstinate&mdash;most obstinate, Rosamund; and I must
say that you don't take after the Stanfields at all, not
at all!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell's grievances, thus expressed,
began to be too much for her; she spoke through tears.
"I am sure I have tried to do my very best by you,
Rosamund, since Mamma died!  The accounts the
Trust Company made me keep all those years were
dreadful, perfectly dreadful!  But I used to
struggle through them somehow, because I was sustained
by the thought that when you were twenty-five we
could just spend and spend and spend and never have
to bother about keeping accounts or being economical
or anything!  But it will be just the same then!  I
know it will!  Why, you haven't even one automobile!"
</p>

<p>
Her sister's tears and the fatuity of her arguments
were as unfailing an appeal to Rosamund as
they would have been to a man; she got up and put
her arms around Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
"You silly old darling!" she laughed.  "You
shall have an automobile!  You may have two if
you want them, and I will give you every penny of
my income that we haven't spent in the last three
years!  But for goodness sake, don't cry!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell followed up her victory.  "Will
you go to Oakleigh?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund capitulated.  "Oh, I suppose so!"
she said, and shrugged.  Then she added, with a
somewhat malicious little smile, "It goes without
saying that Marshall goes, too?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell lifted her chin.  The line of her
throat was still very pretty.  She smiled at her
reflection in the mirror over the mantel.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be absurd," she said.  "Why shouldn't he?"
</p>

IV
</h3>

<p>
"The Battlefield Hotel," Marshall Pendleton said,
when the question of luncheon was brought up,
"is a wonderful place, Benny; better take us there.
Stopped there with the Willings last summer, and had
eleven kinds of jam and about a hundred kinds of
cake on the table at the same time.  Great!"
</p>

<p>
"Heavens, Marshall!" Mrs. Maxwell exclaimed.
"You know I can't eat sweets!  I'd put on
half a pound after such a meal as that!"
</p>

<p>
Pendleton grinned.  "That was not all, Cecilia,"
he said.  "I'd meant to keep it a secret, and surprise
Benny with it.  He's always out for gastronomic
rarities.  They give you cold cucumbers, cut thick,
with warmish cream poured over them&mdash;real cream,
lumpy, kind you used to have on grandfather's farm,
and all that, you know!  You feel green when you
first see it.  Then you wonder what it's like, but
remember that your cousin somebody-or-other, the one
you're not on speaking terms with, would inherit all
you'd leave if you died.  Then you begin to reason
that other people must have dared and survived, and
then you taste it and&mdash;consume!  It's truly wonderful,
Benny; better take us there!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you inviting us to a suicide pact, Marshall?"
Flood asked.
</p>

<p>
The others laughed, and Flood and Mrs. Maxwell
exchanged memories of queer dishes while Pendleton
pointed out to the chauffeur the intricate way
through the narrow streets.  Only Rosamund was
silent, leaning back in the cushioned corner, looking
abstractedly at the quaint doorways and gardens they
passed.  During the preceding fortnight, with
Oakleigh crowded with guests, it had been easy enough
to avoid Flood's companionship, which was beginning
to make her more and more uneasy, in spite of
his earnest effort to keep it for the present on the
level of the commonplace.  But, now that they were
alone there, a party of four, and with Cecilia and
Marshall in one of their intervals of mutual absorption,
there was nothing to do but submit to the situation.
She had welcomed Flood's suggestion of the
day before that they should motor up to Bluemont;
with Eleanor at the Summit, and with the others in
the motor car, Flood's company could be endured for
the day.  So they had left Oakleigh early, and in
Flood's big shining car swung down through the
mountains, out upon the plain, and into the quaint
little town of Battlesburg.  Rosamund's imagination
peopled again the streets and fields with soldiers in
blue and gray.  She knew where her father had
fought and lain wounded.  As they passed swiftly
between the innumerable monuments her heart
throbbed.  From the vast field of graves the spirit
of the past arose and spoke to her&mdash;spoke of the men
who had fought and died there, spoke of the greater
man who had led and forgiven.
</p>

<p>
But during all the journey she had been intensely
bored; more, she was deeply provoked, and in that
state of mind where everything jars and trifles loom
as mountains.  Pendleton's silly chatter seemed
unendurable; she resented his nonsense almost as if it
were an insult thrown at the sacredness of the
battlefield.  She hated his story of the cucumbers and
cream.  When the landlord told them they would
have half an hour to wait before luncheon, she walked
to the farthest end of the veranda, and stood,
looking down the little narrow street.  Mrs. Maxwell
threw herself into a large yellow rocking chair, and
Flood leaned against the veranda railing, facing her.
Pendleton was entering their names in the office, and
wonderingly inspecting the landlord's showcase of
battlefield relics.  Flood lighted a cigarette, and as
he blew out the smoke, turned towards the end of the
veranda where Rosamund stood.  Cecilia watched his
face for a moment or two; then she said:
</p>

<p>
"You must not be offended with Rosamund's
ways, you know!  She is not like anybody else."
</p>

<p>
Flood turned his head and smiled into her eyes.
He waited a full half-minute before he replied.
"No," he said, slowly.  "No, she is not like anyone
else!"  He took several deep breaths of his cigarette,
then spoke with little pauses between each phrase, as
if he were thinking out what he had to say.  "She's&mdash;she's
a dream-woman come true!  She's the lady
of one's imagination!"
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" Mrs. Maxwell remarked, with sisterly
lack of enthusiasm.  Flood threw back his head
with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder which surprises you most," he said,
"to hear that said of your sister, or to find out that
I have an imagination?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell had had time to become an adept
at begging the question.  "Well," she said, "one
doesn't usually associate imagination and&mdash;dream-women,
you know, with your type.  I mean, with
business men!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pray don't mind saying 'my type'!  It's
good for me to hear it, because it is just there that I
lose.  I <i>am</i> of a different type&mdash;or class&mdash;from you
and your sister; even from our friend Pendleton.
Miss Randall sees that, and she will not try to look
beyond it.  She will not let herself know me better,
because she doesn't want to; and she doesn't want to
because I am not&mdash;I suppose she'd call it her 'sort.'"
</p>

<p>
He spoke without a trace of bitterness, and smiled
again at Mrs. Maxwell's well-executed manner of
protest.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no one knows that better than I do," he
went on.  "She's five or six generations ahead of me
in civilization, you know; her grandmother left off
where my grand-daughter would have to begin.
That's why I want her.  I'm naturally impatient, and
I want to see my wife doing and feeling and thinking
a lot of things that are quite beyond my apprehension.
She's just what I've always imagined a woman
ought to be, and I want her."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think she'd credit you with any such
imagination," Mrs. Maxwell said, adding, somewhat
dryly, "with any imagination at all!"
</p>

<p>
"That is just my difficulty," Flood replied.
"She will not give herself a chance to find me out."  He
smiled as he met her puzzled look.  "You know&mdash;I
am only stating the fact&mdash;I have&mdash;er&mdash;accumulated
a great deal of money&mdash;a great deal, more than
I know myself!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell's fingers curled a little more
closely about the arms of her chair, and she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there are only two ways of doing that.
There used to be three.  There was a time when a
man could accumulate a fortune by saving; but in
this day and generation no accumulation of savings
amounts to what we call a fortune.  Nowadays a
man can dig up a fortune; or he can so follow the
daring of his imagination as to make a reality of
what only existed, before, in his own ambitious
dreams.  I think it is safe to say that all but one per
cent. of the great fortunes that are got together
nowadays are done so by the exercising and ordering of a
man's imagination.  Well, I've made such use of
mine that I'm a rich man, as far as money goes, at
forty-three.  Now my imagination is busy along new
lines.  Money is only the key: I want to enter the
garden.  I believe she'd realize every ideal I have!
You are quite right.  There's nobody like her!"
</p>

<p>
His face flushed deeply as he spoke, but Mrs. Maxwell
was not looking at him.  "Oh, dear," she
sighed, "I do wish she were not quite so&mdash;odd!"
</p>

<p>
"Not odd," Flood contradicted, though pleasantly
enough, "but supreme!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell's eyebrows went up.  Ordinarily
she was too conscious of what might be expected of
her breeding to be disloyal to her sister; but Cecilia
was not an angel.
</p>

<p>
"She is supremely full of notions," she remarked.
"How any girl with her money can prefer&mdash;actually
prefer&mdash;to dress as she does, and to live as she does,
and to go about with one maid between us&mdash;I cannot
understand it!  She doesn't spend a thousand a
year on her clothes, and she doesn't own so much as
one motor car!  You may call that sort of thing
supreme; I call it odd!"
</p>

<p>
Pendleton had come out and joined Rosamund.
They were obviously unaware of Flood's gaze, but
Mrs. Maxwell rather disdainfully noticed that his
look had softened as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "that is unusual, as far as my
experience goes; but I rather think she is quite
capable of doing the unexpected.  That's another part
of her charm for me.  I can only guess at what she
would do or think, you know.  And she's so far
beyond me that while money is almost the whole show
to me, it doesn't count at all, with her!  Jove!  I
wish she might have the spending of mine!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell fairly shivered at the thought of
Flood's millions going to waste, as she expressed it
to herself; but fortunately for her peace of mind
luncheon was announced, and they went into the
little Dutch dining-room to investigate the cucumbers
and cream.
</p>

<p>
At the table Rosamund lost some of her pensiveness;
and when they came out again to the sight of
the fields where the armies had fought and died, and
were once more in the car, she bent towards Flood
with eyes burning with excitement, lips parted and
hands clasped.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried, "I am glad, so glad I came,
Mr. Flood!  It is going to be a wonderful afternoon!
I am thrilling even now!  The suffering and the
sacrifice and the glory!  They have left their marks
everywhere, haven't they?"
</p>

<p>
Flood looked at her with admiration so engrossing
as to make him scarcely aware of what she said;
Pendleton was discussing roads with the chauffeur,
but Mrs. Maxwell turned in her seat.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth are you talking about, Rosamund?"
she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"The battlefield!" the girl explained.  "The
field and the marking stones, the orchard where
Father was wounded&mdash;all, all of it!  I am going
over it bit by bit, every inch of it, and I'm going to
thrill, thrill, thrill!  Probably cry, too!" she added.
"I hope you brought your vanity-box along, Cecilia!"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear child, we are going to the Summit!
We are going to see Eleanor!"
</p>

<p>
For once Cecilia welcomed the thought of
Eleanor, but Rosamund only laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Flood will bring us another day to see
Eleanor," she said, "won't you, Mr. Flood?  To-day,
Cissy darling, I am going to see Battlesburg&mdash;just
as if I were a tourist!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell looked at her in amazement.
"Rosamund!" she cried.  "Mr. Flood!  Marshall!
Marshall!  Please!  Mr. Flood, you certainly did
not bring us on this trip to go sight-seeing, did you?
Marshall, did you ever hear anything so absurd?
Rosamund wants to go paddling about in this&mdash;this
graveyard!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was unabashed.  "Yes, of course I
do!" she said.  "So do you, don't you, Mr. Flood?
And, Marshall, you know you've wanted to fight a
battle over again ever since the last one we had at
my ninth birthday party, when I pulled your hair
and you were too polite to smack me!"
</p>

<p>
"I never wanted to fight in all my life, Rosamund,"
Pendleton drawled.  "Certainly not on a
day like this, and after a Dutch midday dinner."
</p>

<p>
Flood was embarrassed, and looked it; but
Mrs. Maxwell gave him no chance to reply.  "Rosamund,
I hate to speak so plainly," she said, "but there are
times when you go too far with your absurdities.
Nobody goes sight-seeing; we are Mr. Flood's guests,
and we have miles of steep road to get over this
afternoon; you cannot upset his plans in this way.
Besides, it's altogether too warm for exertion&mdash;and
emotion.  You'll have to get your thrills in some less
strenuous way.  I simply refuse to be dragged over
any battlefield in existence."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell sank back in her corner, and resolutely
looked away; Rosamund, still smiling, turned
towards Flood.
</p>

<p>
"We'll leave her in the car to amuse Marshall,
and we'll take one of those funny little carriages,
won't we, Mr. Flood?"
</p>

<p>
Her smile and little air of confidence brought
color to Flood's face; he opened and closed his hands
nervously.  His boasted imagination failed him.  The
lady of his dreams was doing the unexpected.  His
voice showed his perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Randall, I'd do anything in the
world to please you!  There are some miles of
mountain roads to be gone over, if we are to get back
to-night, but"&mdash;he leaned towards her&mdash;"when you
ask me, you know I could not refuse you anything in
the world, even at the risk of Mrs. Maxwell's
displeasure!"
</p>

<p>
His words and manner instantly accomplished all
that Cecilia's insistence had failed to do.
Immediately Rosamund's face lost its bright eagerness for
the same indifferent coldness that she usually showed
him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by all means, let us remember the mountain
roads, Mr. Flood," she said, leaning back upon
the yielding cushion, turning her head to look
listlessly out of the car.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please!" poor Flood exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia began to chatter gaily, and Marshall bent
over his road maps.  The car flew out of the town,
noiselessly except for the faint humming of its swift
onrush, the modern song of the road.  But, to
Rosamund, there was no melody in the song; she was out
of tune with the day, with her companions, with the
ride itself.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
Perhaps, if the events of the next few hours had
come to pass at any other time, they would not
have left the same mark upon her life.  As it was,
Rosamund had come to that state of moral restlessness
which is bound either to open the windows of the
soul to fresher air and wider fields of vision, or else
to induce the peevish discontent which so often falls
to the lot of the idle woman.  Although she
consciously longed for happiness, she knew that she was
not sentimentally unhappy; neither was she fatuously
so, like her sister.  Cecilia was only one of many
women of her age and class, who imagine that possession
brings enjoyment.  She often declared that if
she had as much as her acquaintances she could make
herself content, but that if she had more than they she
could be supremely happy.  Rosamund had no such
illusions; her clear mind had never been perverted
to the futility of such ambitions, although there was
nothing in her environment to suggest a satisfying
substitute for them.  If she was restless, it was not
for something she might not have.  It pleased her
pride to think that she valued neither wealth nor
social eminence, but accepted them only as her
birthright; but, as in the case of the infatuated Flood, she
resented any sign of invasion upon the sacred precincts
which for generations had respected their Berkleys
and their Stanfields and Randalls.  It was her
pride which had induced her to neglect, as
unimportant, the things Cecilia yearned for; Rosamund
Randall was to be above manifestations of
wealth&mdash;although Rosamund Randall was not above
occasional haughty stubbornness.
</p>

<p>
The charitable pastimes in which some of her
friends indulged held no appeal for her; she was too
impatient for immediate results to be successful in
them.  She vaguely felt that some fault must lie with
the unfortunate, and she could not imagine that the
individual might be interesting.  Even Eleanor's
experience, although it had stirred her heart to pity,
brought her no closer to the mass of suffering.  She
had no particular talents, no pet enthusiasms; yet
her intelligence was too keen to be satisfied with the
round of days that constituted life for Cecilia, as
well as for most of their friends.  Nothing suggested
itself as a substitute for them, and to-day not even
the charms of nature satisfied her, however beautiful
the country through which the big car carried them.
But insensibly it made its effect upon her.  Away from
the scars of battle, through orchard and grass-land,
between fields of ripening corn and pastures where
drowsy cattle were ruminating in shady fence-corners;
past little white farmhouses with red barns at their
backs, and tangled gardens where bees feasted in front
of them; up towards the hills, through stretches of
cool woodland, where little spring-fed brooklets
crossed the road, and where the turns were so narrow
that the call of the horn had often to pierce the
stillness; out again upon cleared spaces, and at last
far up on the mountain-tops&mdash;so they traveled, Rosamund
alone seeming to notice the beauties they passed
so swiftly.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia kept up an easy chatter with the two men.
Flood seemingly had eyes for the older woman only,
yet he was keenly aware of the girl beside him.  All
the way he was inwardly cursing himself for the
ill-timed compliment which had silenced her, and he was
too good a judge of human nature to follow his first
mistake with a second.  If Rosamund wished to be
silent, no interruption to her revery should come
from him, at least.  As there was only the one way
across the mountains, Pendleton had put away his
road map and was leaning sideways over the back of
the seat, facing Cecilia and Flood; the three found
plenty to talk about, and ignored Rosamund's
pensive withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
For miles they had passed no living thing; even
the birds and woodland creatures seemed to have gone
to sleep; and the chauffeur, taking them along at
second speed, believed it unnecessary to sound his horn
at every winding of the road.
</p>

<p>
Then, so suddenly that no one knew just what
had happened, there was a shriek from somewhere,
a wild cry from the man at the wheel, a stopping of
the car so quickly as to throw the women forward
and Flood to his knees.  Pendleton, facing back, was
the only one who could see the road behind them;
with a cry that was either oath or prayer, he leaped
from the car and ran back, the chauffeur scarcely
four yards behind him.  Flood scrambled up and
Rosamund sprang to her feet.  Cecilia covered her
ears with her hands, and was the only one who could
voice her horror.
</p>

<p>
"We have killed someone!" she cried wildly,
crouching down to shut out sight as well as sound.
"We have killed someone!  Oh, what shall we do?
What shall we do?  I cannot see it&mdash;I cannot stand
the sight of it!"
</p>

<p>
But no one heeded her outcry.  Flood had opened
the door and was speeding after the others; and
Rosamund, too, as quickly as her trembling would
allow her, ran towards the little group at the roadside.
</p>

<p>
When she reached them, they were bending over
two forms&mdash;a boy and a young girl.  The boy had
been struck by the step of the car, and lay huddled
where its force had thrown him; the girl lay beside
him, her face down in the weeds and grass.  Pendleton
and the chauffeur, with ghastly faces, were feeling
for her heart.  As Rosamund came up they
turned her upon her back.  Rosamund tore off her
gloves, and pressed her hand against the girl's throat.
</p>

<p>
"I think she has only fainted," she said.  "Get
a cold thermos bottle, someone!"
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur ran to do her bidding, but before
he got back the girl had opened her eyes.  Rosamund
bent closer.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?" she asked.  "Did we hit you?
Can you speak to me?"  But the girl could not answer
at first; then the iced water and something from
Flood's pocket flask revived her, and she sat up,
leaning against Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
"Gee!" she said.  "I was scared!  What d'yer
think of an automobile up here!  Where's Tim?"
</p>

<p>
The men had left the girl to Rosamund, and
were kneeling by the child; Rosamund glanced over
her shoulder at them.  "I'm afraid he is hurt," she
said.  "Do you think you can take care of yourself
for a moment while I see?  I wouldn't try to stand
up quite yet, if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sure," the girl replied.  "They ain't
anything the matter with me.  You go right on."
</p>

<p>
But all of Rosamund's ministrations failed of any
response from the boy.  Flood's varied experience
had given him a passing acquaintance with broken
bones, but he could find none in the little limbs that
were thin to emaciation; his search revealed only a
few scratches on the child's face, and a cut on his
head.  At last he looked across the little form at
Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there's concussion," he said.  "We
shall have to take him to a doctor."
</p>

<p>
The girl had risen, and was standing, with arms
akimbo, looking down at them.  "Doctor Ogilvie,"
she said at once.  "He's the one.  He's right over at
the Summit."
</p>

<p>
Flood looked quickly at Rosamund.  "Ogilvie!
I had no idea his territory extended this far!"  Then
he turned to the girl.  "So you know Doctor Ogilvie?
How far are we from the Summit?"
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  I dunno!  It's awful far to walk it, I
know that!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund looked up with troubled eyes.  "There
must be some house near by," she said, "where we
could take him.  I don't believe he ought to be
carried very far.  Do you live near here?" she asked
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Laws, no!  We live in the city, him an' me.
We ain't any kin, y'understand; he's a tubercler, an'
my eyes give out, and we're just visitin' Mother
Cary."
</p>

<p>
Flood was becoming impatient.  "Well, where
does the Cary woman live?" he demanded.  "We
don't need your family history, my girl."
</p>

<p>
Instantly the girl's black eyes flashed, and her
chin went up.  "Well, an' you ain't goin' to get it,
my man!" she returned.  "I know the likes of you;
seen you by the million!"
</p>

<p>
She glared up at him belligerently, but Rosamund
laid her hand on her shoulder.  "Don't," she
said quietly.  "Where is this place where you're
staying?"
</p>

<p>
"It's just back of the woods there.  The road's
on up a piece, about two squares; yer can't miss it,
'cause it's the only one there is."
</p>

<p>
So they lifted the child, and laid him carefully,
on the broad back seat.  They decided that
Mrs. Maxwell and Pendleton should wait beside the road,
while Rosamund and Flood saw to the boy's safety,
and the girl rode with the chauffeur to point the way.
She seemed but little impressed by the accident, and
greatly pleased at the motor ride.
</p>

<p>
"Laws, but I wish the girls at the factory could
see Yetta Weise settin' up here," she remarked as
she took her place.
</p>

<p>
As she had told them, the house was not far; and
notwithstanding her anxiety for the injured boy,
Rosamund looked at it in amazement, so unlike was
it to anything she had ever seen, so quaintly pretty,
so tidy, so homelike.
</p>

<p>
It stood on the hillside, a few yards back from
the road.  From a little red gate set in the middle of
the whitest of tiny fences a narrow brick path led
straight to the front door.  The upper story of the
house overhung the lower, making a shady space
beneath that was paved with bricks and made
cheery and comfortable with wooden benches piled
with crocks and bright tin milk pans set out to air;
and all about the little white farm-buildings wound
narrow brick paths bordered with flowers&mdash;geraniums,
nasturtiums, pansies, with, here and there,
groups of house plants in tin cans and earthen pots,
set outside for their summer holiday.  Unaccustomed
though she was to such ingenuous simplicity of
decoration, Rosamund could not but recognize it as a
haven of peace, a little home where love and time had
impressed their indelible marks of beauty.
</p>

<p>
The big car drew up to the gate very gently;
Yetta called, loudly and shrilly; Flood lifted the boy
and carried him towards the house, and Rosamund
followed; but halfway up the path she paused, half
in amazement, half in repulsion.
</p>

<p>
Yetta's call had brought to the doorway the
strangest of small creatures&mdash;a tiny, bent old woman.
She braced herself on one side against the doorway,
on the other with a queer little crutch with padded
top, held by a strap across her shoulder; as she came
forward to meet them she moved the crutch, like
some strange crab, obliquely, grotesquely, yet with
the adeptness of the life-long cripple.  She was
evidently startled, even frightened; but when her eyes
met Rosamund's she smiled.  At once the girl's
feeling of repulsion vanished, for on the tiny old face
there was none of the suffering and regret that so
often mark the deformed.  It was not drawn or
heavy; plain and homely though it was, it was made
radiant by a world-embracing mother-love, transfigured
by that quality of tenderness and sweetness
that Rosamund had learned to associate with
pictured mediæval saints and martyrs.  With Mother
Cary's first smile, something entered the girl's
consciousness which never again left it.
</p>

<p>
The old woman paid no attention to Yetta's voluble
explanations, nor wasted any time on questions.
</p>

<p>
"Take him into the room on the left and lay him
on the sofy," she directed, and hobbled along behind
the little procession; but when they had lain the still
unconscious child in the shaded best room, she looked
from Flood to Rosamund for explanation, with a
dignity which could not fail to impress them.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he's just been knocked senseless," she
said, when they had told her all they could.  "But
anyways, we ought to have Doctor Ogilvie here's soon
as ever we can.  If the young lady'll help me undress
the little feller, you can take Yetta, sir, to show you
the way."
</p>

<p>
Flood hesitated; to undress the child would be a
strange task for Rosamund.  "Can't I do that
before we go?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
But the old woman had no such hesitation.  "No,
you can't," she said, "an' I wish you'd hurry.
Timmy ain't strong, anyway."
</p>

<p>
So, with a troubled look, Flood followed Yetta,
and in a moment Rosamund heard the purr of the
motor as the car sped off towards the Summit; then,
as she afterwards remembered with surprise and
wonder, she found herself obeying the old woman's
directions.
</p>

<p>
"Now, honey, you jest lift the little feller right
up in your arms, bein' careful of his head; he don't
weigh no more'n a picked chicken.  We'll get him
to bed time the doctor gets here, an' have some water
b'ilin' an' some ice brought in, case he wants either
one.  Here, right in here&mdash;my house is mostly all on
one floor, so's I can manage to scramble around in it
when Pap's in the fields.  That's the way&mdash;no, he
won't need a piller.  I'll take off his little clo'es whilst
you lift him&mdash;that's right.  My!  Think o' that
gentleman wantin' to do for him&mdash;as if any woman with
a heart in her body could let a man handle sech a
little thing's this!  But he didn't know, did he, honey?"
</p>

<p>
And strangely enough Rosamund was conscious
of a wave of tenderness towards the pathetic little
figure, limp and emaciated; long afterwards she
realized that people always did and felt what Mother
Cary expected them to.  She even bathed the little
dusty feet, while the old woman hobbled about to
bring her different things, talking all the while.
</p>

<p>
"Pore little soul, seems like he had enough without
this&mdash;not but what I reckon he'll come out o' this
a heap sight easier than he will the other.  Not a
soul on the top o' the yearth to belong to, he hasn't;
sent here to fatten up an' live out o' doors, 'count o'
being a tubercler.  No, honey, he ain't nothin' to Pap
an' me 'ceptin' jest one o' the pore little lambs that
have a right to any spare love an' shelter an' cuddlin'
that's layin' around the world waitin' for sech as him.
I used to wonder why the Lord let sech pore little
things stay in the world, until I found out how much
good they do to folks that look after 'em.  Land!  I
wouldn't be without one of 'em on my hands now, not
for more'n I can say.  What?  Oh, yes, dearie, I take
one or more of 'em and build 'em up an' get 'em well,
with Doctor Ogilvie's tellin' me how; an' when they
go back to the city all well again, I jest take one or
two more.  Pap an' me wouldn't know what to do
now, ef we didn't have some pore little thing to look
after.  I'm jest that selfish, I begrudge everybody else
that has a bigger house the room they got for more
of 'em."
</p>

<p>
When the child had been made clean and cool,
and the old woman had shown Rosamund how to
draw in the blinds and leave the room in pleasant
shadow, she led the way out to the paved place in
front of the house.
</p>

<p>
"You look all tuckered out, honey," she said,
when Rosamund had sunk wearily into a rush-seated
armchair, "an' I'm goin' to get you some fresh
milk."
</p>

<p>
So for a few minutes the girl was alone, with time
to think over the crowding events of the past half
hour, which seemed almost like a day.  One emotion
had come closely upon another, and now she was in
this strange little harbor where, apparently, only kind
winds blew, the storms of the world outside, a harbor
where weak vessels found repair, where passers-by
were welcomed and supplied with strength to go on.
Subconsciously she wondered whether it might not be
the harbor of a new, fair land, herself the storm-buffeted
traveler about to find shelter.  Then, more
in weariness of spirit than in bodily fatigue, she drew
the long hatpin from her hat and tossed it aside,
leaning her head back against the stone of the house,
and closed her eyes.
</p>

<p>
When Mother Cary returned with a glass of
creamy milk, she noted the girl's pallor, the shadows
her long lashes cast on her white cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't feel too bad about it," she said.
"The little feller can't be hurt very bad, and I reckon
it was jest bein' so scared an' so weak, anyway, that
made him go off in his head like that."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund could not confess that her thoughts
had been of herself rather than upon the injured
child.  "Do you think he will recover?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what Doctor Ogilvie can't do ain't to be
done, I know that much," Mother Cary replied.
"Folks do say it's an ill wind blows nobody any good,
an' it cert'n'y was his ill wind blew us good; 'cause if
he hadn't been that sick he couldn't live in the city, he
never would 'a' come to the mountings, an' I'm sure I
don't see how we ever did get along without him.
Why, he's that good a doctor folks still come up here
from the city to see him; and many's the one stays at
the Summit just to be where he can look after them;
and Widder Speers that he lives with told me that
doctors from 'way off send for him to talk over sick
people with them&mdash;jest to ask him what to do, like.
Oh, Doctor Ogilvie can do anything anybody can!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was amused, in spite of herself, at the
old woman's naïveté.  "He was sick, then, when he
came?" she asked, idly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you'd never 'a' known it," Mother Cary
told her.  "Land!  How he did get about from place
to place, huntin' out other folks that was ailin'!  He
hadn't been up here more'n a month before he knew
every soul in these mountings, which is more'n I do,
though I've lived here forty year an' more.  He jest
took right a holt, as you might say.  That's how
come I begun to take care of these pore little helpless
city things.
</p>

<p>
"First time he come here, he looked all about
the place when he was leavin', an' he says to Pap,
'Plenty o' good room an' good air you got here, an'
I guess there's plenty o' good food, too, ain't there?'  Pap,
he says, 'Well, we manage to make out, when
the ol' lady feels like cookin'!'  An' the doctor
laughs an' says to me, 'Ain't got quite as much to
do as ye had when that son an' daughter o' yours
were home here, have ye?  Don't ye miss 'em?'  At
that the tears jest come to my eyes, like they always
do whenever I think o' my own child'en bein' two or
three miles away from me on farms o' their own; an'
the doctor he smiles an' says, 'Well, I'm goin' to
supply your want,' he says.
</p>

<p>
"Pap an' me never thought 'ny more about it
tell a week or so later when we see him drive up
behind that old white horse o' his with the puniest little
boy alongside o' him ever I set my two eyes on.
'Here's something to keep you from bein' lonesome,
Mis' Cary,' he says; an' ever since then, it bein' goin'
on five year, I've had one or another o' them pore
little&mdash;land!  There he comes now, without a sign
of a hat on his red head!  Ef he ain't that forgetful!"
</p>

<p>
Flood's big car had whirled rapidly into sight
along the woodland road, and before it stopped the
doctor was out and into the house.  When Mother
Cary hobbled in, Rosamund remaining to say a word
or two to Flood, the doctor was already bending over
the injured child.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia was waving a frantic hand from the car,
and Rosamund and Flood walked down the little path
to the red gate.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your hat?" was the first thing
Mrs. Maxwell asked Rosamund.  "Do get in!  We've
miles and miles to go, and we've wasted hours!  I'm
sure I don't see why they couldn't have sent for the
doctor in the ordinary way; why, the road back there
was something terrible!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was conscious of an absurd longing to
slap or pinch Cecilia; she was really too vapid for
polite endurance.
</p>

<p>
"We can't possibly leave until we know how
badly hurt the child is," she said, and deliberately
turned and walked back into the cottage.
</p>

<p>
After a moment or two Flood followed her, leaving
Cecilia to pour out her indignation upon Pendleton.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was just coming out of the little
bedroom, and nodded to them both in a general way.
Rosamund looked at him curiously.  She noted with
some amusement that his hair was, as Mother Cary
had somewhat more than suggested, frankly red; not
even the best-intentioned politeness could have called
it sandy.  He was of average height, with keen eyes
which looked black, although she afterwards knew
them to be gray; his breadth of shoulder made him
seem less tall than he was, and his frame was
rather lightly covered, although his very evident
restless energy seemed more responsible for it than any
evidence of ill-health.
</p>

<p>
"Must have jabbed his ribs," he said, looking at
Flood with a half smile, and seemingly ignoring the
presence of this girl from his old familiar world.
"Cracked a couple of them, but they're soon mended
in a kiddie.  Only thing now is this slight concussion;
needs careful nursing for a few days."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned, looked squarely into Rosamund's
face, and issued his orders in precisely the manner of
a doctor to a nurse, without a trace of hesitation,
apparently without a shadow of doubt that she would
obey.
</p>

<p>
"Keep ice on his head, you know, and watch him
every minute through the night.  He's not likely to
move; but if he should become conscious&mdash;&mdash;"  He
continued his directions carefully, explicitly, all the
while looking at Rosamund intently, as if to impress
them upon her.
</p>

<p>
While he was speaking, Flood's face flushed
darkly.  With the doctor's last phrase, "Only be
sure to watch him every minute," he spoke sharply.
"You are making a mistake, Doctor Ogilvie," he
said.  "Miss Randall is not a nurse."
</p>

<p>
The doctor instantly replied, "I know she isn't,
but we'll have to do the best we can with her!"
</p>

<p>
Flood's face grew redder still; Rosamund smiled
a little.  "Miss Randall cannot possibly stay here,"
Flood said.  "That is entirely out of the question.
I am willing to do all I can for the child, and I am
very glad he is not seriously hurt, although the
accident was, I think, unavoidable.  I will send a nurse
to-morrow&mdash;two, if you want them.  But you will
have to get along with the help here for to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't any," said the doctor, briefly.  "Yetta's
a child, and Mother Cary goes down to her daughter's
where there's a new baby."
</p>

<p>
For a moment no one spoke.  Mother Cary was
smiling at Rosamund, and her look drew the girl's
from the two men.  Then her smile answered the old
woman's.
</p>

<p>
In a flash of inspiration she knew that she had
found an answer to her questions of the earlier hours;
something in her heart drew her symbolically toward
the little silent, helpless child in the darkened room
behind her, some mother-feeling as new and wonderful
as the dawn of life.  Both Flood and the doctor
remembered, through all their lives, the look of
exaltation on her face when she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I will stay," she said, quietly, and walked into
the darkened room.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
During the long silent watches of that night
there came to Rosamund one of those revelations,
fortunately not rare in human experience, by
means of which the soul is taught some measure of
the power of the infinite&mdash;power to change or to
create, to lead, to see more clearly, or better to
understand.  The afternoon had been crowded with new
impressions and emotions following each other so
swiftly as to preclude consideration of them, but
during the hours beside the unconscious child her mind
was busy; one thing after another came back to her,
and, reviewed in comparison with all the other
happenings of the day, took its rightful place of
importance or unimportance.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-072"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-072.jpg" alt="&quot;One thing after another came back to her.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;One thing after another came back to her.&quot;
</p>

<p>
After the car had borne away her irate sister and
friends, the red-headed doctor carefully went over
his directions to her, and she had some difficulty in
ignoring the twinkle in his eyes; Cecilia's horror and
Flood's disgust had been as amusing as Pendleton's
lazy irony.  But before supper the doctor, too, had
hurried away.  Flood had not offered him a lift, and
the walk back to the Summit was long.  Father Cary,
whom she found to be a friendly giant with a
well-developed rustic sense of humor, had driven off with
his tiny wife down the mountain to their daughter's
home, leaving Yetta to clear away the supper.
</p>

<p>
Until then the black eyes of that other daughter
of cities had scarcely left Rosamund.  As soon as she
had washed and put away the dishes, she came to the
door of the room where the little boy lay, and after
asking if 'the lady' were afraid of the quiet and
dark, she went upstairs.
</p>

<p>
Then Rosamund stood at the window and watched
the stars come out.  The great boles of the oaks and
chestnuts in the strip of woods across the way drew
about themselves mantles of shadow.  An apple fell
from a tree near the low, white spring-house, and a
cricket began to chirp.  From some lower mountain
slope there sounded the faint tinkle of a cow bell, and
still farther down the valley twinkling lights marked,
in the darkness, the places where people were
gathered&mdash;little beacons of home; and she knew that
overhead there shone another light, set in a window
by the old woman before she went down the
mountain.  The placing of that light in the window,
Mother Cary had told her, was the uninterrupted
custom of the house since her first child was born.  On
that day of wonder, when the shadows had deepened
in the quiet room where the miracle had taken place,
they had set a lamp on the window sill, and a light
had burned in the same window every night since
then, a signal to all who should see it that happiness
had come to live on the mountain, and still dwelt
there.  It was so small a light that, even when dark
closed in, the girl standing beneath it could scarcely
discern its rays; yet she knew that it was large enough
to be seen far off, miles down the valley, across on the
other mountains.  Flood had told her of seeing it
from Doctor Ogilvie's house at the Summit.  She
felt its symbolism&mdash;so small and humble a light,
shedding its rays and carrying its message so far; and
with that thought there came another.
</p>

<p>
This humble life of love and service, how beautiful
it was!  Only that morning she had believed her
life the real one, her world the only one worth living
in; but already she was beginning to suspect that there
might be a life more real, a world less circumscribed.
She looked back into the little bedroom, and beyond
into the dimly lighted kitchen; it was so poor a house,
so rich a home!
</p>

<p>
And of their poverty these mountain folk had
given immeasurable largesse to how many waifs&mdash;dust
of the city's greed and sin, taken them into this
loving shelter, tended them back to usefulness, taught
them cleanliness of heart and body.  Yet even to the
waif so rescued the city's power of harm reached out!
How strange it was that the boy lying there should
have escaped so many of the city's dangers, found this
safe refuge on the mountain, and then have been
injured on a quiet country road by one of those very
dangers he had dodged every day since he first
toddled across city streets!
</p>

<p>
As she watched the child, another thought presented
itself, caused her cheeks to burn in the dark,
sent a wave of disgust and shame over her: these
people, who had added nothing to the city's harm,
recognized their responsibility to the city's offspring;
whereas Flood and Pendleton, her sister and herself,
who fed upon the city and its workers, would almost
have left the boy by the roadside, but for very shame
of one another.  Her friends believed her whimsical,
unreasonable, utterly foolish to watch beside him
through one night; and she had been, in her inmost
heart, taking credit to herself for doing so!
</p>

<p>
She asked herself whether, indeed, she would have
remained, if it had not been for the compelling force
of Ogilvie, no less insistent for being unvoiced.  She
recalled what Flood had told her about him; yet,
now that she had met him, all of Flood's enthusiasm
did not seem to explain the man, and she smiled as
she remembered how little of that enthusiasm poor
Flood had shown in his disgust at Ogilvie's quiet
demand for her assistance.  She felt suddenly ashamed
as she admitted to herself her secret delight in
teasing Flood and Cecilia and Marshall by obeying the
doctor's appeal.  In her growing humility she was
almost ready to believe that there had been no
impulse of good in her remaining.  Yet she knew that
she would have had to remain, even if the others had
not been there.  What manner of man, she wondered,
was this red-headed country doctor who had first
aroused the admiration of a man like Benson Flood,
and now had forced Rosamund Randall to perform
a service that, a day before, she would have thought
a menial one?  Certainly he must differ in many
respects from the men she had hitherto met.
</p>

<p>
The loudly ticking clock on the kitchen mantel
struck off hour after hour.  A lusty cock began
calling his fellows long before the fading of the stars.
Rosamund, standing again at the breast-high casement
of the little window, for the first time in her
life watched the day break.  Rosy fingers of light
reached up from the eastern mountains; valley and
hillsides threw off their purple and silver wrappings
of night, and gradually took on their natural colors;
little fitful gusts of air, sweet with night-drawn
fragrance, touched her face at the window; from
their nests in the near-by fruit-trees faint, sleepy
twitterings soon increased to a joyful chorus of bird
music; the shadows melted, it was day, and the world
awoke; but it was a new world to Rosamund.  She
had touched the pulse of life, and with the dawn
there was born in her heart a purpose, feeble and
immature as yet, but as surely purpose as the newborn
babe is man.
</p>

<p>
Father Cary came up the mountain early to attend
to his cattle, bringing word that his daughter
was not so well, and that Mother Cary could not
leave her until later in the day, but that Miss Randall
was to feel at home, and Yetta was to do all she could
for her comfort.  He had made breakfast ready by
the time Rosamund came into the kitchen; and
presently Yetta stumbled down the stairs, yawning and
sleepy-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"Gee!" she said, by way of morning greeting,
"If this place ain't the limit for sleep!  When I first
come up here I jist had to set up in bed an' listen to
the quiet; kept me awake all night, it did.  Now I
want to sleep all day an' all night, too!  Ain't it
the limit?"
</p>

<p>
"But that's the best thing in the world for you,"
Rosamund said, and smiled at her.  The girl must
have divined a difference in the smile, for she beamed
cheerfully back.
</p>

<p>
"That's what Doctor Ogilvie says," she replied.
"All's the matter with me is m'eyes.  Y'see I been
sewin' ever since I's about as big as a peanut; first I
sewed on buttons to help my mother, an' then I sewed
beads.  There was my mother an' me an' m'father,
on'y he wasn't ever there; an' we had four boarders.
Course the boarders had to set next to the light, an'
I couldn't see very well.  Then after my mother died,
I sewed collars day-times and beads at night, till I
got the job in the shirt-waist shop.  Tha's where
m'eyes got inspected&mdash;they don't never inspect you
till you get a good job.  It don't do me no good to
know my eyes is bad; I could a told 'em that m'self&mdash;only
thing is, that was the reason they sent me up
here, so I've that much to thank 'em for, I guess.
Still, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Father Cary interrupted the stream of chatter.
"Now look a here," he said, "supposin' you do
less talkin' an' more eatin'!  Two glasses of milk,
two dishes o' oatmeal, and two eggs is what you got
to get away with before you get up from this table."
</p>

<p>
But Yetta's tongue was irrepressible.  "You
watch me!" she replied, and grinned at him, her
black eyes sparkling.  "That's another funny thing
about the country," she informed Rosamund, nodding.
It was evident that she believed Miss Randall
to be as much a stranger to the country as she
herself had been.  "In the city all you want to eat in
the mornin' is a bite o' bread an' some tea; nobody
ever heard o' eatin' eggs in the mornin', nor oatmeal
any other time; but here&mdash;Gee!  I can stow away
eggs while the band plays on, an' tea ain't in it with
milk&mdash;this yere kind o' milk!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's strained ear caught a faint rustle
from the inner room; she sprang up, followed closely
by the others; the child had moved his head, and his
eyes were closed; before that they had been ever so
slightly open.  Rosamund laid her hand upon his
forehead, bent down so that his breath fanned her
soft cheek.  Then she looked up at Father Cary.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he is really sleeping, not unconscious,"
she whispered.  "I think we must keep very, very
quiet."
</p>

<p>
Yetta nodded, tiptoed out of the room, and
presently Father Cary's large form passed the window
on the way to the stable.
</p>

<p>
So again was Rosamund's vigil renewed, unbroken
through several hours except by faint noises
from without, the humming of a locust, the chirps of
birds, the homely conversation of some chickens, who
had stolen up to the little house, lonely for Mother
Cary.  She must have dozed, for it seemed only a
short time before the kitchen clock struck eleven, and
almost at the same moment the doctor stood in the
doorway, with Mother Cary behind him.
</p>

<p>
The doctor's hair had been very much blown by
the wind, but it would have taken more than wind to
send his smile awry.
</p>

<p>
"Morning!" he threw towards Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
She was at once aware that he thought of her
only as the child's nurse, oblivious of all that other
men saw in her, of her beauty and grace, of the signs
of wealth and well-being in her garments and bearing.
It amused her, though her smile was, perhaps, a
little disdainful.
</p>

<p>
The boy was better; the doctor could find no serious
injuries.  "I am sure the car barely touched him,"
Rosamund said, and the doctor nodded.
</p>

<p>
"But it sometimes takes so little to shock the life
out of a little underfed, weakened body like this," he
said.  "There's nothing to fight with, nothing to
build on."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's hand went over her heart.  "Then
you think," she asked, "you think that he will
not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I am very sure that he will,"
the doctor smiled at her.  "Mother Cary, here, will
teach you how to make him well."
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary laid her wrinkled hand on the girl's
arm, but Rosamund's eyes filled with tears.  "Poor
mite!" she said, bending over the child, "we will
try to make you well&mdash;but I don't know what for!"
</p>

<p>
Then Mother Cary spoke for the first time since
her return.  "Don't you trouble yourself about the
what for, dearie," she said.  "Folks is got plenty to
keep 'em busy with the 'what way' and the 'what
next' without troublin' themselves with the 'what
for.'  Ain't it so, Doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"It most certainly is," the red-headed doctor
agreed, running his fingers through his already tousled
hair.  When he had given her further directions for
the care of the child and driven off behind his jogging
old white mare, he seemed to have left with her some
of his own happy energy and assurance.  Quite suddenly,
the fatigue of her sleepless night fell from her,
and from some unsuspected inner store-house of
strength there crept a serenity and determination
hitherto undreamed of.  The boy would sleep, the
doctor had told her, until late afternoon, probably
awake hungry and thirsty, and then ought to sleep
again; he must be kept very quiet, nourished regularly
and lightly, made clean and comfortable; such
careful and ceaseless nursing should, in a week or two,
bring him out with even more strength than he had
had before.  So, until afternoon, there would be little
for her to do.
</p>

<p>
She went into the kitchen to be with the old
woman, who was moving about with her queer, crab-like
motion of crutches and hands, preparing their
dinner; Yetta had taken herself to the fields.
</p>

<p>
"No, indeedy, you can't help me one mite,"
Mother Cary declared, "exceptin' by settin' in that
arm cheer and puttin' your pretty head back and
restin.' There's nothin' I enjoy more'n a body to talk
to whilst I'm a gettin' dinner, or supper.  Yetta ain't
that kind of a body, though!  Land!  The way the
child can talk, and the things she knows!"  Mother
Cary turned about from her biscuit board to
emphasize her horror.  "Honey," she said, impressively,
"that child knows more o' the world, the bad
side of it, than&mdash;well, than I do!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund smiled, and the old woman shook her
head at her.  "Oh, I was brought up in the city,
honey," she told her, "so I know more about it than
you think for.  That's what makes me glad the doctor
brought us a girl, this time; she's the first girl we've
had this summer.  I wisht it might be that she could
stay up here as I did, but land! they ain't but one
Pap!  Pap jest made <i>me</i> stay, and me a cripple, too!
He said he couldn't be happy without somebody to
look after; and whilst it was a new idea to me then,
I come to see the sense of it many a long year ago!
That poor little Yetta!  It's her eyes is bad.  They
ain't so bad but what they won't do well enough for
most things; but all she knows how to do is to sew
beads and buttons and run a big sewin' machine in a
shop.  They say her eyes won't hold out for that!
Land!  If I was rich, I'd have her taught music,
that's what I'd do!  You jest ought to hear the child
sing, dearie!  To hear her in the evenin's settin' down
on the fence an' singin', why, it's prettier 'n a
whip-poor-will a-callin'.  It wouldn't surprise me a mite
if Yetta could be learnt to sing that well, with some
new songs and such, that folks would pay money to
hear her!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we could find some way to help her,"
Miss Randall suggested.  Mother Cary flashed a
keen look at her.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know any rich folks, honey, that
might?" she asked eagerly.  "Yetta's a good little
thing, for all the bad she knows.  An' she jest loves
an' loves whatever is pretty an' sweet!"
</p>

<p>
"I think perhaps I do know someone," Rosamund
said.  "But I wanted especially to ask you to let me
board with you here for a while.  Is there room for
me?"
</p>

<p>
"Room a plenty, dearie," the old woman said, as
she hobbled to the door to strike the metal hoop that
swung from the over-hanging floor of the second
story.  "But," she added, when she had sent the
summons ringing out to Pap and Yetta, and had come
back and seated herself near the girl, "but there ain't
any call for you to pay.  Pap an' me has a plenty to
share with folks that come our way; and you're
helpin' with Timmy.  I'd be real pleased to have you
stay."
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund hesitated.  "I'm afraid I cannot do
that," she said, "unless you will let me pay something.
I can afford it, really," she added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
For a long moment the old woman looked at her,
keenly, kindly, with the faintest, tenderest, most
teasing smile on her little wrinkled face that was as
brown as a nut.  "An' can't you really afford to
visit?" she asked.  "There's a plenty of folks that
can afford to pay and to give; there ain't so many as
can afford to take and to be done for.  Ain't you
forgettin' which kind you be?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund lifted her head, and looked directly
into the twinkling, faded old eyes.  "No," she said,
"I'm not forgetting the kind I am!  I think I am
only beginning to find out!"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary laid her hand over the girl's in her
usual gesture of caress before she hobbled to the
dinner table.  Pap and Yetta had come in and were
already seating themselves.
</p>

<p>
It was the sweetest meal that Rosamund had ever
tasted; but she had still to find out more about
herself.  They had not risen from the table when a
musical view-halloo sounded up from the road below
the stretch of woods, and in a moment Flood and
Pendleton sprang out of the big red car and came
briskly up the little walk.  Rosamund went forward
to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I say," said Flood, beaming at her,
"you're looking right as a trivet, you know!"
</p>

<p>
Pendleton drawled: "Ah, fair knight-errantess!
Miss Nightingale!  Also Rose o' the World!  You
wouldn't be smiling like that if you knew Cecilia's
state of mind!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed, and held out her hand to
them.  "I can imagine it," she said.  "It's plain that
I had better keep out of her way for a time!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm at your service," cried Flood bowing low:
with mock servility, delighted at her merry mood, at
her smiles which included even himself.
</p>

<p>
But Pendleton understood her better.  "Now,
what are you up to, Rosy?" he asked, severely,
uneasily.  She came directly to the point.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to stay here," she announced.
</p>

<p>
Both men stared at her.  "How d'ye mean?"
asked Flood weakly.
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you are!" cried Pendleton.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  With Mrs. Reeves!" Flood beamed, as
if he had found an answer even while asking.
</p>

<p>
"Is that it?  Why didn't you say so?  Where is
Eleanor, anyway?" Pendleton asked.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed again.  "I'm sure I don't
know!" she said.  "She is at Bluemont, and that's
miles away, isn't it?  I haven't even asked.  No,
Marshall, no, Mr. Flood, I am going to stay here, right
here, here in this house, or this valley, or this
mountain, but here, here as long as I like&mdash;forever, if I
want to!  That's what I mean&mdash;or part of it!"
</p>

<p>
It was evident that her laughter carried more
conviction than any amount of seriousness would have
done.  Poor Flood's face got redder, and he
suddenly, after a stare, turned on his heel, and walked
rather slowly down the path to his car, standing
beside it with his arms folded, looking across at the
strip of woods, but seeing nothing.  Pendleton,
however, felt it incumbent upon him to remonstrate.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, we all know you can afford any whim
you like, Rosamund," he said, in the tone of the old
friend who dares, "but I think I ought to warn you
that this sort of thing is not&mdash;not in the best of taste,
you know!  It is not done, really&mdash;in&mdash;in&mdash;among
our sort, you know!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund openly showed her amusement.  "That
is undoubtedly true, my dear Marshall," she said,
"but this time it is going to be done!  <i>I</i> am going
to do it!  You think it is a freak, and I'm sure I can
say it isn't, because I don't in the least know what
it is!"
</p>

<p>
"I think you're mad.  If I had not been an
unwilling observer of the accident, I should believe it
was you had got concussion, and not the infant."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Marshall, your diagnosis is wrong!  I
may have a&mdash;a disease, but it is not madness.  Did
you ever hear of people who had suffered from loss
of memory for years and years and quite suddenly
recovered it?  Perhaps I'm one of those&mdash;I feel as
if I had only just come to my senses!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you're talking about!" said
Pendleton.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?  I thought you wouldn't!"  Again
she laughed, and at the sound Flood started, looked
back towards the house where she stood, radiant and
lovely, framed in the doorway, and then got into his
car.
</p>

<p>
But Pendleton had one further protest.  "You
<i>can't</i> stay in this&mdash;this hovel, alone, Rosamund!
You can't think of doing it!  Please remember <i>I</i>
have got to go back to Cecilia!  What on earth am
I going to say to her?"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Marshall!  Tell Cecilia, with my love,
that I am going to stay here for the present.  She may
send me some clothes by express, or not, as she likes.
Please give her my love, and tell her that I hope she
will have a pleasant visit with the Whartons&mdash;she
had better go there to-morrow.  And try, my dear
Marshall, to assure her of my sanity!  Good-by!
Don't let me keep you waiting!"
</p>

<p>
Pendleton pushed back his hat, thrust his hands
deep into his pockets, and looked at her.  Then he
drew a long breath and delivered himself, oracularly.
"Rosamund," he said, "you're a fool!  You can't,
you really can't, do this sort of thing, you know.
Why, my dear girl, it&mdash;it is not done, you know,
in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund ran back into the house, turned
a flashing, smiling look upon him over her shoulder,
cried, "Good-by, Marshall!  Give my love to Cecilia!"
and was gone, leaving him there agape.  There
was really nothing for him to do but rejoin Flood.
</p>

<p>
Cecilia, however, remained for a time inconsolable.
Flood and Pendleton motored back across the
mountain, told Mrs. Maxwell of Rosamund's decision
to remain indefinitely in the little cottage on the
mountain, and forthwith avoided the presence of the
irate lady as much as possible.  Fortunately, the
newly arriving week-end guests had to be entertained.
They were very good and very stupid; but, as Pendleton
said, anything was better than Cecilia in a temper.
</p>

<p>
Left to herself, Cecilia's mind was occupied with
a veritable jack-straw puzzle of events, motives,
contingencies.  She had had good reason, before this, to
know that Rosamund enjoyed unforeseen departures;
but that anyone should deliberately choose to forego
the luxuries of Oakleigh, to stay, instead, in what
Mrs. Maxwell considered a peasant's cottage&mdash;such
conduct, such a choice, were beyond the lady's
imagination and experience.  Rosamund must be wild; for
surely not even pique at Cecilia's generalship, not
even annoyance at Flood's attentions, not even the
desire to be near that tiresome Eleanor Reeves, could
have determined her to such a move.  As for the
accident, anyone could have cared for the child.
Rosamund could have paid a dozen nurses to stay there, if
she was charitably inclined; and certainly Mr. Flood
had shown that he wanted to do what was right.
Cecilia could not understand it.
</p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
After the retreat of Pendleton and Flood,
Rosamund went back to the little boy's room,
smiling.  Mother Cary looked up at her with a face
slightly troubled.
</p>

<p>
"Seems like your friends ain't willing to have
you stay here," she said.  "Is there anything calling
you home, honey, anything that needs you?"
</p>

<p>
The girl shook her head.  "I think I have never
been needed anywhere in all my life, until now," she
said.  Then, perhaps because of Flood's words, she
remembered Eleanor.  "Well, perhaps there is one
person who has needed me, from time to time; and,
dear Mother Cary, she is somewhere near here.  She
came to Bluemont to be near Doctor Ogilvie."
</p>

<p>
"There's a many a one that does," said Mother Cary.
</p>

<p>
"My friend is Mrs. Reeves.  Do you know her?"
</p>

<p>
"Land, honey, rich city folks don't bother to
become acquainted with the likes of me!" the old
woman said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Reeves is not 'rich city folks.'  She is
working for her living all the while she is here in the
mountains; she is companion for another of the
doctor's patients, Mrs. Hetherbee."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know!" Yetta exclaimed.  "I saw her
in the post-office one day askin' for the mail, while the
old one waited outside in the automobile.  Gee!
That old one looked cross!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed.  "And do you know where
they live?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Want me to show you?"
</p>

<p>
"I should like it ever and ever so much if you
would take a note there for me.  Could you do that?
Is it too far?"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary patted Yetta's dark hair.  "She
can go over with Pap, when he goes to the store," she
said.  "She'll be real glad to; won't you, Yetta?"
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that in the late afternoon
Eleanor came in Mrs. Hetherbee's car.  The boy Tim was
resting so quietly that Rosamund had gone outside;
she went swiftly down the little red path to the gate,
and the two met, arms entwining, cheek to cheek, with
little laughs and questions and soft cries.
</p>

<p>
"Your note said there was an accident!"  These
were Eleanor's first words.  "Darling, that is not
why you are here?  You are not hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"Why I am here; but it was not I&mdash;I was not
hurt!  Look at me&mdash;feel me!"
</p>

<p>
"Nor Cecilia?"
</p>

<p>
"Nor anyone, you precious, that you know!  A
tiny mite of a boy, Eleanor, and I stayed to take care
of him."
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't say it like that!  And yet I don't wonder!"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor's arm was about her at once.  "Sweet,
I was only wondering that Cecilia let you!"
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia did not let me; and you were wondering,
too, why I stayed, what really kept me.  You
are quite right; of my own accord I shouldn't have
stayed.  My own impulse would not have moved that
way.  I should have taken the easy, the obvious
course, if I had been left to choose.  But I wasn't,
you see."
</p>

<p>
Eleanor looked at her keenly.  This note of
bitterness was quite new.  Suddenly she remembered
Ogilvie; but almost on the instant Rosamund spoke
again.
</p>

<p>
"What manner of man do you find this red-headed
doctor of yours?"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor laughed.  "He gets his own way with
people!"  She looked at her friend, but Rosamund's
face was turned from her.  "I have never met anyone
else like him.  I thought at first that he was two
people&mdash;a man of heart and a man of science; you
know his reputation, and yet he stays up here mainly,
I am told, to be near these mountain people.  He says
that they trust him, and seems to think that excuse
enough for staying."
</p>

<p>
"I thought he stayed for the air or something?"
</p>

<p>
"He did, but now he is perfectly well again.
And his character is not dual; nothing so romantic.
He is a man of science just because he is a man of
heart.  He is one of the simplest people I have ever
known."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to know him pretty well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is the first object of interest to all his
patients; we talk of nothing else!  I am only a case
to him."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed.  "Very likely, dear!  And
what does he think of you, as a case?"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor's face took on its shadow of sadness.
"He&mdash;he does not know," she said; and Rosamund
drew a swift breath of pain.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor came daily after that, Mrs. Hetherbee,
a worn, eager little woman with restless eyes, showing
herself entirely complaisant when it seemed likely
that the very well known Miss Randall would return
Eleanor's visits.  Her attitude towards her companion
had been pleasant enough before, but it certainly took
on a new warmth after Rosamund's arrival in the
neighborhood, and when she learned that Mrs. Reeves
was one of Miss Randall's lifelong friends.
</p>

<p>
"You will have to drive over and call on
Mrs. Hetherbee, Rose," Eleanor assured her.  "If you
don't I shall feel that I'm using her car under false
pretenses!"
</p>

<p>
So Rosamund called, and Mrs. Hetherbee basked
in the distinction of being the only person at the
Summit whom Miss Randall cared to know.  Thereafter
Eleanor came daily across the valley, tenderly
sweet as only she knew how to be, almost at once
becoming fast friends with Mother Cary, and hanging
over the boy with aching heart and arms weary
of their emptiness.  Rosamund always felt as if a
hand of pain clutched at her heart as she watched
them.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" Eleanor had asked the first day
she saw him.  "Is he the child of these people?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a waif," Rosamund said, and told how
Mother Cary made of the little white house a refuge
of love for the needy ones of the city.  "And this
tiny boy, Doctor Ogilvie says, needs love more than
most of them.  The Charities have tried to have him
adopted; but most people do not want boys&mdash;not
homely little boys, whose fathers were not at all good
and whose mothers died very young and very
forlorn.  Timmy has gone begging&mdash;and he will have
to go back after his summer here is over.  The most
to be hoped for is that he will go back stronger; then
perhaps he will be prettier, and some one may want
him.  It is really unspeakably pathetic."
</p>

<p>
So Eleanor hung over the child, and gradually
there grew up in Rosamund's heart and mind a plan,
which, as it matured, was to alter the course of life
for all of them.
</p>

<p>
But that was not until later; and while to her on
the mountain the days passed uneventfully enough,
they were days of distressful change for her sister.
During the first week or two, Cecilia sent her four
letters and eleven telegrams&mdash;the telegrams being
duly delivered with the letters, whenever Father Cary
drove across the valley to the store.  Rosamund read
them all, pondered, smiled, and then sent off a
reassuring telegram by Eleanor.  Later she wrote two
letters; the first was to her banker, and in the second
she said:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
DEAREST CISSY:
</p>

<p>
Don't be too cross!  You've always been an angel
to me, and I love you; but I am tired, tired, tired of
the sort of life we lead; and the other day, when
Mr. Flood's man so obligingly bumped into the poor little
boy, I was wondering how on earth I could get out
of it for a time, get some sort of change.  Then, the
people here seemed to take it for granted that I would
stay to nurse the child.  It was the first time in my
life that anyone had ever taken for granted that I
would do the right thing if it meant personal discomfort.
Before, I had always been praised and applauded
if I merely happened to do it.  I don't suppose
I can make you understand, dearest Cissy; but
just that made all the difference in the world to me.
And now I am going to stay here&mdash;for how long, I
do not know.  Until I get tired of it, perhaps, or
until I can think up something else.  The mountains
are so big, Cecilia, and the stars so bright, and the
sun does such good work!
</p>

<p>
I have put some money to your credit; I think
there will be enough to last you for a while.  You can
even get the motor car, if you want to.  And if I
were you, I should stop in town and get a few linens
and perhaps a hat or two and a parasol at Lucille's.
You will need a lot of things at Bar Harbor.  I
suppose you will go right up to the Whartons'.
</p>

<p>
You say I have broken up Mr. Flood's plans.
I'm afraid I don't altogether agree to that.  There
was only another week-end left in June, and we were
not going to stay any longer than that.  I do not
choose to think that you referred to other plans of
his.  If you do, please understand that I have no
interest in them.
</p>

<p>
Give my love to the Whartons; they have always
thought me queer, anyway, so you will not have to
account to them for me.  And don't be too cross!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Cecilia's reply, which the doctor brought up the
mountain a week later, was dated from Bar Harbor.
It read:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
DEAR ROSAMUND:
</p>

<p>
It's no use saying what I think.  But you are
exceedingly disagreeable about Mr. Flood, and the
mountains were just as big at Oakleigh, and the sun
is just as hot in one place as another at this time of
year, and it is very selfish of you to break up
everybody's plans.  But at least I can say that I am glad
you remain sane upon some subjects.  I hope you
got the trunks I sent over to Bluemont Summit; and
I took your advice about the linens.  There was a
white serge, too, that was unusually good for the
price.  I haven't decided about the car.  We play
bridge here twice a day, and my game seems rather
uncertain, since the shock you gave me.  And Minnie
has invited Benson Flood for two weeks, and a good
many things may happen.  I may not buy the car after
all.  I told Minnie that you were camping in the
mountains, and she only raised her eyebrows.
Well&mdash;all I can say is that poor dear Mamma always
admitted Colonel Randall was peculiar.  If you are not
going to wear your opals this summer, you may as
well let me have them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed aloud at the letter.  Doctor
Ogilvie was sitting on the side of Timmy's bed, and
she had gone to the window to read it.  At her laugh
he looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Good news?" he asked, cheerfully.  He was
always cheerful, as cheerful as a half-grown puppy.
</p>

<p>
"Neither good nor bad," she replied, "only amusing."
</p>

<p>
"But whatever is amusing is good," he asserted.
</p>

<p>
She looked up from folding her letter, to see
whether he was in earnest.  "That," she said, slowly,
"is rather a unique point of view!"
</p>

<p>
He ran his fingers through his hair, and came
towards her.  "Unique?  I hope not," he replied.
"Oh, I see what you mean&mdash;you're taking issue with
my word 'amusing'!  I'm not thinking of passing
the time, as a definition of that word; I'm thinking
of fun, mirth, that kind of amusement&mdash;nothing to
do with chorus ladies and things to eat and drink and
that sort of thing, you know!"
</p>

<p>
She was learning to watch his smile as one
watches a barometer; to-day the signs were certainly
propitious.  There was something of indulgence in
her look as she replied to him, the indulgence one
feels towards the young and inexperienced.
</p>

<p>
"So you think it is a good thing to be amused&mdash;in
your way?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  "Most assuredly.  Nothing like it.
And the most amusing thing I know is the way we
can cheat disease and dirt and a few other nice little
things like them&mdash;turn the joke on them!  Now,
there's Master Tim&mdash;eh, youngster?  Life will seem
like a good deal of a joke to you, when you get over
that ache in your hip, won't it?  Think you'll find
fun in life then, don't you, old chap?  And there's
a girl down in the valley&mdash;by the way, how'd you
like to go down with me and make a call?  Do you
a lot of good!"
</p>

<p>
He cocked his head on one side and looked at
Rosamund inquiringly, persuasively.
</p>

<p>
She had seen him every day for two weeks, and
this was the first moment he had looked at her with
the least shadow of personal interest.  Until now, she
had felt that she was no more to him than an article
of furniture, certainly less of a personage than
Mother Cary or Yetta or the sick child.  She had a
feeling that he tolerated her solely as an aid, that
she had not even the virtue of being a 'case'; and
she told herself in secret disgust that while she did
not possess the last virtue, she at least shared the
patients' fault, or absurdity; she had to admit that he
piqued her interest, and she resented his doing so,
blaming him even while disgusted at herself.
</p>

<p>
But, to-day, with the charming woman's intuition,
she knew that he was seeing her with different eyes,
as if she had only just now come within his range of
vision; yet she knew that his was a look that she had
not encountered from other men.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto, the men she knew had been quite
evidently aware of her beauty.  She had always
accepted, quite calmly, the fact that there was enough
of that to be of first consideration, over and beyond
anything else that she might possess.  This country
doctor was the first man who had ever appeared
unconscious of the excellence of her femininity; but the
same pride which had led her to repel Flood's
admiration forbade her making any conscious appeal
for Ogilvie's.  There was, after all, very little of the
coquette in her.  The amusement that his obliviousness
caused her, or the interest it excited in her, was
only increased by his suggestion that she should
accompany him on a visit to some mountaineer's
cottage; he had offered it as likely to do her good, and
not, as she might not unreasonably have expected,
that her going would brighten or benefit or honor the
mountain girl.  It was a new experience, surely, for
Rosamund Randall!
</p>

<p>
On their way down the mountain, which White
Rosy knew so well that to guide her would have been
entirely superfluous, he talked cheerfully, as always,
of many things&mdash;of White Rosy herself, of the mountain
people, of the view across the valley, of roadside
shrubs and flowers.  It was the first of their drives
together, and the woman they went to see that day
became a most important factor in their destinies.
</p>

<p>
At first she listened to him with scarcely more
interest than she would have felt towards the amiable
volubility of any of the countrymen; but his talk soon
rose above the commonplace.  Insensibly he became
aware that the girl beside him could understand,
could sympathize, respond.
</p>

<p>
"I know you can't put ropes on the world and
try to pull back against its turning round," the doctor
said when at a bend of the road they could look down
almost upon the roof of a cottage below, a cottage
with a sadly neglected garden patch at one side and
a tumbled-down chimney.  "It's a good deal better
to stand behind and push, or to get in front and pull.
I'm fond of pulling, myself!  But when it comes to
the individual instance, it's sometimes more merciful
to stand in the way of what we're pleased to call
progress.  Now that girl down there&mdash;daughter of
a horse-dealer, the owner of a little store at one of
the crossroads in the other valley&mdash;it would really
have been better if she had never gone to school,
never been away from home, never learned of
anything beyond what she has.  She has been taught
enough to make her know how badly off she is.  Her
father was ambitious, and sent his daughter to board
in town and go to the high school.  She stayed there
two years, and absorbed about as much as she could;
then she came back home, but her education had
taught her something finer and better than what she
came back to.  She did just what any restless young
thing would do.  Inside of a year she eloped with
the handsomest rascal in the mountains.  And
Tobet's a moonshiner!"
</p>

<p>
"Moonshiner!  But I thought the Government
had done away with all that sort of thing?  I heard
a man say, at a place where I was staying before I
came here, that there was really no more of it left,
in these mountains.  The men are intimidated, the
stills discovered and broken up.  Isn't that so?"
</p>

<p>
A wry smile from the doctor answered her.
"Then there must be some natural springs of it about
here," he said.  He pointed back over his shoulder
with his whip.  "See that big pine up there on the
left?  Well, if an empty bottle be left there, at the
foot of the tree, at night, with a fifty-cent piece under
it, the bottle will be filled in the morning, and the
coin gone.  I don't ask any questions, and I suppose
she would not answer any; but if she would, Grace
Tobet could explain how that sort of thing happens."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was not greatly impressed.  "Well,
there probably is not very much of it," she said, "and
they must be quite used to it.  I don't suppose it does
them much harm, does it?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor was silent for a moment.  Then he
said, and his voice was very low, "Grace Tobet has
lately lost her baby, her little girl.  Joe came in one
morning, struck by white lightning, as they say
around here.  He fell on the baby, and Grace came
in from the garden too late.  She told Mother Cary
that perhaps it was just as well."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund paled.  Presently the doctor went on,
"And you see, poor Grace knows better things; she
remembers that town and the school, and the little
pleasures and gayeties there."
</p>

<p>
Neither spoke again until White Rosy drew up
before the Tobet cottage.  The front windows and
door were closed, but on the sill of the back door a
woman crouched, a woman in faded brown calico,
whose face, when she raised it from her arms, showed
a dark bruise on one side.  She rose and smiled
wanly.
</p>

<p>
"I've brought a lady to see you, Mrs. Tobet,"
the doctor said.  He introduced them as formally as
if Grace Tobet had been a duchess.  Then he said,
"Now you two talk, while I hunt up Joe.  Where
is he?"
</p>

<p>
The woman nodded towards the front of the
house, and the doctor went indoors.  Rosamund and
Mrs. Tobet looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
To the mountain woman this stranger was a being
from another sphere, who could not touch her
own at any point of intercourse; while Rosamund was
too deeply moved by the woman's story, by the livid
mark on her temple, by the squalor of her dress and
surroundings contrasting so strongly with the intelligence
of her face, to find words.  It was Mrs. Tobet
who first remembered one of those phrases of
common coin which are the medium of conversation the
world over.
</p>

<p>
"Stranger about here?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I am staying with Mrs. Cary on the mountain,"
Rosamund replied; and, as, in a flash, the other
woman's face was lit by a smile scarcely less radiant
than Mother Cary's own.
</p>

<p>
"A friend o' Mother Cary's, be ye?  I'm glad
to see ye!  I can't ask you into the front room, but
there's a seat in my spring-house, real pleasant and
cool; won't ye come try it?"
</p>

<p>
She led the way through the neglected garden to
the little spring-house that was built of the rough
stone of the hillsides, roofed over with sod.  In front
of the door-space was a wooden bench, where Rosamund
sat down, while Grace drew a glass of sparkling
water from the cool spring inside.  It was a
delicious draught.
</p>

<p>
"My baby could jest pull herself up by that
bench," Grace Tobet said, as she took the empty
glass.  "She used to play here while I tended to the
milk.  Joe's sold the cow now; but that didn't make
any difference; there wasn't any reason for keeping
her."
</p>

<p>
The woman's deep-set dark eyes strained out
towards the mountain-tops.  Rosamund felt herself
suddenly brought face to face with some primal force of
which she had hitherto known nothing; for the first
time in her life she looked upon the agony of bereft
mother-love laid bare.  She had been with Eleanor
through her loss, but Eleanor's grief had seemed to
turn her to white stone; this other mother's was a
fiercely scorching, consuming flame of anguish before
which Rosamund shrank away as from the blast of a
furnace.  Before she dared to speak, however, Grace
Tobet's face was smiling again.
</p>

<p>
"I know you must like it up there," she said.
"I do miss the mountains so, livin' down here in the
valley.  I don't know what I'd do ef it wasn't for
Mother Cary's light.  I look up there for it every
night of my life, an' it's always there.  An' I ain't
the only one it talks to, neither."
</p>

<p>
"It has its message for everyone who sees it, I
think," Rosamund agreed.  "I know, because I am
living under it!"
</p>

<p>
Grace looked into her eyes, and nodded.  "Ain't
it so?" she replied.  "Why, there's never been a
night when I was in trouble that her little lamp hasn't
said to me, 'Here I am, honey, an' I know all about
it.  When it gets so bad you can't stand it, you jest
send for me; I'll come!'  An' she does come, too!"
</p>

<p>
There was silence between them for a moment;
then Rosamund said, only wondering at herself long
afterwards, "It says more than that!  It is telling
me that there is something in life worth while, that
there's courage and goodness in many a dark corner
where we'd never think of looking for them; oh, it is
teaching me a great deal!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Grace Tobet agreed, and all barriers
between them were gone.
</p>

<p>
They found so much to say that the hour the
doctor spent with Joe passed like a moment.  When at
last he came out of the house and back to the spring
for a drink of the pure water, the two women
walked together to the buggy; and before she took
her place Rosamund, yielding to a sudden impulse of
which she knew she would have been incapable a
fortnight earlier, turned and clasped both of the
older woman's hands, and looked into her face.
</p>

<p>
"Will you be friends with me?" she asked simply.
</p>

<p>
Grace Tobet's eyes widened.  It seemed long
before she spoke.  Then, "Yes," she said, and both
knew that there was something sealed between them.
</p>

<p>
"May I bring a friend of mine to see you?  She
lost her baby boy last year, and&mdash;and we are afraid
she is going to be&mdash;blind.  Perhaps you can comfort
her, in some way.  She needs friends.  May I bring
her?"
</p>

<p>
"Pray do," Grace said, in the quaint mountain speech.
</p>

<p>
When they were slowly climbing the mountain,
the doctor turned to Rosamund with a quizzical
smile.  "You and Grace seemed to progress
somewhat!" he said.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments Rosamund pondered; then
she met his look, but there was no smile on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," she said, "I have always
thought that the people I lived among were the only
ones who really knew life, the only ones who felt, or
thought, or <i>lived</i>!  Lately I seem to have come into
a new world."
</p>

<p>
The doctor's smile faded, and he ran his fingers
through his hair.  "No," he said, "it's the same old
world!  Human nature's pretty much the same,
wherever you find it.  Human experience is bounded
by life, and the boundaries are not very wide, either.
It's the different combinations that make things
interesting, although the basic elements remain the
same!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I almost think there are more basic elements
among these people than among&mdash;my kind!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  The difference is that with your kind
the surface is rounded and polished, and the points of
possible contact therefore fewer; with the other kind
the rougher surfaces offer more points of contact,
more chances of combinations, that's all.  And," he
added, "even that's only partly true!"
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, when she went over in her mind the
events of the whole afternoon, she wondered how
Flood or Pendleton would have expressed themselves
on the subject; but at the moment she was too deeply
concerned with her problems to form any mental
digression.  For a while neither spoke; then she said:
</p>

<p>
"Reserve seems to have no place here!  I find
myself saying what I think, describing what I feel,
opening my heart to Mother Cary, to Mrs. Tobet, to
you&mdash;to anyone!  I do not know myself!"
</p>

<p>
The doctor's face changed from one expression to
another and another; he was about to speak, but her
look was intense, rapt, uplifted, and very serious;
he evidently changed his mind.  Neither spoke again
until they stopped before the little green gate.  Then,
he passed his hand over his head as if suddenly
missing something.
</p>

<p>
"Lord bless my soul!" he exclaimed.  "I believe
I left my hat at Grace's!"
</p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Eleanor was most free to motor across the
valley&mdash;where now a double magnet drew her&mdash;while
Mrs. Hetherbee still slumbered in the mornings.
Since the first day when Tim's little hand had
reached up to touch her cheek, she had yearned
towards the boy.  Rosamund laughingly accused her of
coming to see him instead of herself; Eleanor, in
reply, held the mite to her heart, smiling over his curls
through gathering tears, at Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
The summer had done much for Timmy.  The
pain in his hip was disappearing, and by the end of
August there were pink baby curves where the skin
had been white and drawn over his little bones.
There were times, when he was cuddling against
Eleanor or tumbling about in the sun, that he was
almost pretty.  He was glad enough of ministrations
from Rosamund or Mother Cary, but Eleanor was
the bright lady of his adoration.
</p>

<p>
"My White Lady," he called her, taking great
pains always to pronounce every consonant of the
beloved name, though he usually discarded most of
them as not at all necessary to intelligent conversation.
With the inquisitiveness of childhood, he soon
discovered that she had once had a little boy of her
own.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your little boy?" he asked one day
with infantile directness.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone away," she told him.
</p>

<p>
But that was not enough.  "<i>Did</i> somebody 'dopt
your little boy?" he persisted.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor looked at Rosamund; the same thought
was in the minds of both.  How many times had
little Tim been offered for inspection to would-be
adopters, and refused?  How much of it had he
understood?  What had it all meant, to his poor little
lonely heart?  Eleanor drew him more closely to her.
</p>

<p>
"W'y don't you tell Timmy?  Did somebody
'dopt your little boy?"
</p>

<p>
She gave him the simplest answer.  "Yes,
dear," she said.
</p>

<p>
Timmy was thoughtful for a moment.  Then he
said, "I guess he must have been a <i>pretty</i> little boy!"
</p>

<p>
Neither Eleanor nor Rosamund could speak, but
Tim was oblivious of their emotion.  A new idea, an
entrancing one, had presented itself.  He climbed
upon Eleanor's lap, took her face between his palms,
and said, smiling divinely,
</p>

<p>
"If I was a great big man, White Lady, <i>I</i> would
'dopt you!"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Rosamund that Eleanor, while
reaching out with all the ardor of her loneliness, was
being daily wrung by seeing him; she spoke of it to
Ogilvie, after Eleanor herself had denied it.  But he
was inclined to agree with Mrs. Reeves that it could
not harm her.
</p>

<p>
"Women find comfort in strange things," he
said.  "Let her have her own way."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund sighed.  "It does not seem to me that
her summer here has helped her at all," she said.
"She is more a 'White Lady' than ever.  I wish you
would tell me what you think of her, Doctor Ogilvie!"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell you any more than I have," he
replied.  "There is no incurable fault of vision, no
defect of the eye itself.  If I could prescribe a large
dose of happiness for her, she would get well.  As it
is&mdash;nerves have very elusive freaks sometimes, you
know!"
</p>

<p>
"Then she will&mdash;she will be&mdash;oh!  Don't say
that!  Not my Eleanor!"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are taking too much for granted.  I
do <i>not</i> say it.  Her eyes are no worse than when she
came here.  If she were strong they would recover;
if she were happy she would quickly become strong!
As it is&mdash;who can say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how helpless you all are!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
He ran his fingers through his hair&mdash;his cap was
apt to be anywhere but on his head.  "Helpless!
Good Lord, yes!"
</p>

<p>
As the weeks passed, they had become very good
friends, spending many hours together, driving about
the countryside as he made his rounds.  Knowing
Eleanor to be there in the mornings, Ogilvie fell into
the way of making Mother Cary's his first house of
visitation in the afternoon.  They were always
waiting for him at the gate&mdash;the now inseparable three;
and if Rosamund left all show of eager greeting to
Yetta and little Tim, the doctor seemed never to
notice the omission.  It was enough to find her there.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto, John Ogilvie had passed his life, first,
in study, and later in investigation and service.
Women had appeared as people who cooked his meals,
or as nurses trained to careful obedience, or as those
who, more or less ill, were apt to be more or less
querulous.  There were one or two who had seemed
to possess different characteristics, especially here in
the mountains.  There was Mother Cary, who had
helped him on more than one occasion when more
trained assistance, if not assistance more experienced,
was not to be had; he warmly loved Mother Cary,
whose indulgent affection persisted in regarding him
as a boy&mdash;a clever boy, to be sure, but not by any
means one who had outgrown the need of maternal
attention.  And there were Grace Tobet, and a few
other of the mountaineers' wives, who stood out from
the mass of women as he had known them.
</p>

<p>
Miss Randall was of still another sort, already
beginning to inspire him with emotions new and different.
But he was too far past the introspective phase
that is a part of early youth to analyze his emotions.
He was less concerned with the phenomenon of his
own heart throbs than with the happily recurring
hours of their being together, and the increasingly
dreary intervals when his duties carried him away
from her.
</p>

<p>
He knew very well to what world she belonged.
He had had enough experience of it among his
patients, the overfed, overwrought women who came
to Bluemont in the summer to be near him&mdash;near the
young doctor of high scientific attainments, who
remained in this out-of-the-way place of his own choice,
"Who can be just as disagreeable and firm, my dear,
as if his sign hung two doors from Fifth Avenue, and
whose fees are only one-fifth as high as Dr. Blake's,"
as one of them wrote home.  Even if she had not
come into the valley as one of Flood's guests, he
would have known of what class she was a part.
Mrs. Hetherbee, in her overflowing complaisance after
Rosamund's call, had poured out to his bored and
impatient ears, in a torrent that was not to be stemmed,
the facts of the girl's inheritance and position.
</p>

<p>
"Witherspoon Randall's only daughter!  He
made all his money, millions, they say, in Georgia
pine&mdash;only had to go out on the land he had inherited
and cut down trees!  Think of it!  And left every
penny to this girl, nothing to the mother, nothing to
the mother's daughter by her first marriage, nothing
to charity&mdash;everything, everything to this girl!  And
you know she is just the smartest of the smart, in
town; thanks to her sister's marriage, in the very
heart of the most exclusive&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
So he had, in spite of himself, been told what she
was, given some idea of what she possessed; yet so
wholly did he discard as immaterial the material
things, and measure her only by the weight of
personality, that Rosamund was deceived into thinking
that he knew nothing about her.
</p>

<p>
The friends she made while at Mother Cary's
had not questioned her; she had dropped among them
from an automobile, and later her sister had sent her
some clothes of deceptive simplicity.  Their seeming
to accept her as she tried to appear deceived her
into believing that they were not curious; as a matter
of fact their code of good manners forbade their
showing curiosity; nothing could prevent their
having it.  She believed that Ogilvie, also, had been
deceived in like manner.  During their drives together
she carefully avoided any reference to her
possessions; it amused her to imagine how surprised he
would be when he knew.
</p>

<p>
Yet she found herself becoming more and more
contented that he did not know.  In her own world
she had been unable to ignore her wealth; she could
read knowledge of it on every face, deference to it
in every courtesy, and the very fact that it had set her
apart was largely the cause of her old discontent.  She
would not voluntarily have discarded it, but she
would have welcomed an escape from all but its
agreeable consequences.
</p>

<p>
The other men she had known might have been
able to command riches larger than her own, or possessed
that which weighed equally in the social scales;
yet they remained conscious of what her very name
signified, and invariably showed it.  Even Mr. Flood,
or so she believed, although he could have bought all
she owned without missing what it cost him, showed
her the usual deference.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, there was something fresh and unaccustomed
in her growing friendship with Ogilvie.  It
amused and piqued her; in her ignorance of his real
state of mind it even touched her.  She found herself
eager to be real with him, to show him depths of
heart and mind which she herself had scarcely
suspected.  Other men saw only the social glaze which
hid her real self and reflected themselves; Ogilvie
had a way of looking at her which pierced the surface,
although, because of his obvious sincerity, it caused
her no resentment.  So, during the glowing summer,
while the hot noons ripened the corn in the valley and
the cold nights left early beacons of flame in the
young maples on the mountains, they grew to know
each other; she serene in her belief in his unsuspecting
simplicity, he ignoring in her what other men would
so greatly have valued.  As far as the things of the
world affected them, they might, on their drives, have
been alone in a deserted land, or at least in one
peopled only by aborigines.
</p>

<p>
For always he had as an objective point some
mountain cottage where his aid was needed.  At first
she was inclined to be curious about the mountaineers;
theoretically they ought to have been interesting,
quaint, amusing.  But in reality she scarcely saw
them; when she did, she found nothing appealing in
their lank figures, and faces hidden in the depths of
slat bonnets or under large straw hats pulled down
over their eyes.
</p>

<p>
"They all seem to avoid me," she told Ogilvie
one day when he had come out of a house with a tiny
child in his arms, which had slid down and run away
at sight of her.  "Do they think I'm the bogey-man
or the plague?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed aloud at her petulance.  "They don't
stop to think," he said.  "They are as timid as
chipmunks, or as any other hunted woodland creatures."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hunted!" she cried, as if to repudiate what
he implied.  "I've heard you talk like that before!
Do you still believe in that nonsense about the secret
stills and the Government spies, and all that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe in it."
</p>

<p>
"I have been here eight weeks, and I have not
heard another soul speak of it!"
</p>

<p>
"How many of the 'natives,' as you call them,
have you met?"
</p>

<p>
She pursed her lips.  "I don't believe there are
many to see!"
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to remind you again of my feeble
simile of the chipmunks!" he laughed.  "And believe
me, it is more apt than you think.  For instance,
have you seen the little Allen children?"
</p>

<p>
"What, the queer little animals that bend their
arms over their eyes when you meet them, and live in
that shanty back of Father Cary's pasture?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her description.  "Precisely!  The
Carys' nearest neighbors, scarcely a mile away.  And
have you seen their mother?"
</p>

<p>
She seemed to be trying to remember.
</p>

<p>
"Come now," he teased, "don't tell me you don't
believe they have a mother!  The eldest child is not
yet six, and the youngest of the five is two months
old!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed and gave in.  "No, I have not seen
the mother, nor the father, nor the aunts, nor any of
the rest of the family!  But that is only one instance."
</p>

<p>
"There are many; you really may take my word
for it, if it interests you to.  But if you were to be
here after the summer people go, then you'd see.
They come out into the open then."
</p>

<p>
She still looked skeptical, and he pointed up the
mountain.  "Do you see that path?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Where?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "Caught, Miss Randall!  A path
is there, invisible though it is to you&mdash;to us.  All
through these woods there are paths, often little more
than trails, well known to the mountaineers and often
used.  Sometimes they run for a mile or more beside
the road, screened by the undergrowth; sometimes
they keep higher up, or cross where a road could not,
or follow the courses of the streams; but they are
there.  It is only one of the evidences of the
mountaineers' secretiveness."
</p>

<p>
"Your simile was a good one!  What animals they are!"
</p>

<p>
"So are we all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course, you are the doctor, saying that!
But you could scarcely class these creatures with
ourselves!"
</p>

<p>
He turned on the seat to look at her, and she
met his gaze a little defiantly, on the defensive, for
she knew him well enough by now to guess what his
reply would be.  For the first time she encountered in
his eyes a look of appraisement as if he were
weighing her value, even questioning it.  Suddenly there
arose between them the antagonism of their opposite
points of view, of those differences in their minds and
characters which must always arise between a man
and a woman, and be settled by conquest or compromise,
before happiness can be secure between them.
</p>

<p>
As he looked at her, more beautiful in her sudden
proud defiance than he had ever before seen her,
it flashed upon him who and what she was, and that
what he had chosen to ignore might be none the less
placing her beyond him.  In his inexperience he was
unprepared for the swift pain of the idea; instinctively
defending himself, his defense was cruelly sharp.
</p>

<p>
The irony of his words stung her cheeks to a quick
crimson.
</p>

<p>
"I am not capable of judging of your class, Miss
Randall!" he said.
</p>

<p>
She might have understood, from the tremor in
his voice, but she heard nothing but the meaning of
the words.  As she still looked into his eyes her own
widened, and with the widening of their pupils
seemed to grow black.  For an instant they looked at
one another so; but the moment was too tense to be
one of revelation.  Then she drew a gasping breath
so sharp that it almost seemed to be a wordless cry
of pain, and turned away.
</p>

<p>
Instantly he was filled with shame of having hurt
her, and greater shame of having doubted her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, forgive me," he cried.  "Forgive me!
Won't you forgive me?"
</p>

<p>
She lifted her head a little, still turned from him,
but did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Rosamund!" he cried.  "Forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
It was now unmistakably a cry of pain, appealing
and revealing; it steadied her, as a woman is always
steadied by that tone in a man's voice, until the
moment when she is prepared to welcome it.  On the
instant, she was no longer the woman of the past weeks,
simple, companionable, revealing herself as naturally
as a child; she was once more the Miss Randall the
world knew, haughty, reserved, aloof.  Even her eyes,
as she turned to smile at him, were not those he had
known.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing in the world to forgive!  I
think we have been a little absurd!"
</p>

<p>
It was his turn to feel how words could lash.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you see it so," he said, and wondered,
during the rest of their drive, filled as it was
with the commonplace of small talk, how he could
have forgotten her likeness to the vapid, futile,
fashionable women at the Summit; while she, hurt and
bewildered, was wondering what he had meant, whether
he had known her all along for the person she was,
Colonel Randall's daughter and only heir, and in the
stupidity of a countryman had failed in the observance
due to her position.
</p>

<p>
When White Rosy stopped at the little red gate,
willingly, as always, the two children were there to
welcome them.  Ogilvie, in spite of Timmy's beseeching
arms, would not stay to supper, as he often did.
</p>

<p>
Tim sat down on the brick path and lifted his
voice in a wail.  "Oh, ev'rybody's gonin' away!" he
cried; and his anguish increased by his own words, he
further declared, "Ev'rybody has went away!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund picked up the boy, but he wriggled
down from her arms.  In spite of her care for him,
and the good-fellowship there was between her and
both the children, who were ordinarily devoted
enough, nothing of the maternal had as yet been
aroused in her; and in the moments when he needs
the only comfort that satisfies childhood, a child
knows instinctively whether there is aught of the
mother in the arms that hold him.
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund was in need of love to-day.
"Why, Timmy," she cried, still holding him to her,
"<i>I</i> am here!  <i>I</i> have not gone away!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want my White Lady to go away!  I
want my White Lady!" was Timmy's cry.  "Ev'rybody's
gonin' away!"
</p>

<p>
Now Yetta became voluble in explanation of his
cry.  "She is going away!  She came over while you
were gone, 'cause she said maybe she won't be able to
come to-morrow.  She says she's got to pack, 'cause
the old one's going back to town.  Lots o' people
have gone already, it's so cold; and the old one
thinks it's going to set in to rain, so she's going home,
an' Mis' Reeves has got to go with her."
</p>

<p>
"My White Lady's gonin' away!" Tim wailed
again, with a concentration of thought that might
have been admirable under other circumstances.
"Ev'rybody's gonin' away!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund had been overwrought on the drive,
and the boy's persistent cry was rasping her nerves.
"Oh, for goodness' sake, Timmy, don't say that
again!  It is not true, Tim!  I am here, and Yetta's
here, and Mother Cary's here.  Aren't we enough!"
</p>

<p>
"No, she ain't," Yetta cried, still informing.
"She's gone down to her daughter's, 'cause the baby's
sick.  Pap took her, and maybe he'll stay all night, if
it rains, an' he says it's going to for sure.  And I
know what to get for supper, and it's corn puddin'
and jam!"
</p>

<p>
At last they had found the silencing note for
Timmy.  "'Ikes jam!" he announced.  Then, apparently
warming towards Rosamund, he encircled her knees
with his arms.  "'Ikes you, too!" he declared.
'"Ikes ev'rybody!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was glad to laugh, to carry him, with
swings and bounces and kisses stolen from the tangle
of his curls, into the house, glad to make a 'party' out
of the simple supper and a ceremony out of the lighting
of Mother Cary's nightly beacon, glad to hold
him up to the window to see the trees bend under the
wind that came with Father Cary's predicted rain,
and glad to hold his little warm body to her while
she undressed him, and to hear him repeat after her,
in unison with Yetta, the prayer that she was,
somewhat shyly, teaching them.  She was glad when Yetta
claimed the privilege of her fifteen years to sit up a
while longer; glad of anything that might postpone
the moments when she should be alone with her own
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The storm was increasing; each gust of wind
shrieked louder than the last, sending the rain against
the little house in sheets that broke with a sound as of
waves on a shore.  Rosamund, answering Yetta's demand
for a story, regaled her with the tale of Rip
Van Winkle, and then, somewhat unwisely, with the
Legend of Sleepy Hollow, so that when the girl's
bed-time could no longer be put off she pleaded to stay
downstairs with Timmy and herself.
</p>

<p>
But at last Rosamund must be alone with herself
and the storm.  At first she could not think of
Eleanor's message, and what it might mean to her.  She
had forgotten that the summer was almost over,
forgotten that Eleanor's inevitable departure must leave
her alone, as far as old friends were concerned, in the
mountains.  She had even forgotten that she herself
must return; and now she had to remember that
Cecilia's clamor might begin again with any letter.  The
summer was over.  It had warmed into growth some
part of her which had laid dormant before; but, after
this afternoon, she was in no mood to dwell upon
that.  She thought again of Eleanor, of her parting
with the boy.  There must, of course, be something
provided for the poor little waif, and for Yetta; that
would be easy enough; she had only to write a check
or two.  Yet, in spite of the obviousness of that way,
something else, quite different, seemed to be struggling
to formulate itself in her mind; for once the
writing of a check did not appear to be an adequate
solution.
</p>

<p>
But the sum of it all, for her, seemed to be that
she was just where she had left her old self, two
months before.  The old restlessness, the old
discontent, swept back upon her with accumulated force,
only increased by her life here.  The summer had
taught her something, given her something; how
much she was unwilling to admit.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there came back to her the sound of
Ogilvie's voice, when he had called her by name, out
of his shame and pain; and with the memory there
came the reality of his voice, only now it was muffled
by the storm, and by the sound of his knocking on the
door.
</p>

<p>
Startled though she was at its coming in apparent
answer to her thoughts, she sprang to the door and
opened it.  Then, in a quick heat of shame, she
realized that he was far from calling upon her.
</p>

<p>
He stood under the overhang of the upper story,
water dripping from him onto the brick paving, hatless
as usual, tossing the rain from his eyes.  He was
exceedingly far from being a beautiful figure as he
stood there; rather, he seemed a creature of the
storm, wind-swept, rain-soaked, forceful, insistent.
</p>

<p>
"Mother Cary!" he demanded almost before
Rosamund had opened the door.  "Mother Cary!
Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund drew back, as if repelled from the
dripping figure.  Unconsciously she had, expected
something else.
</p>

<p>
"Mother Cary is not here," she said, coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Not here?" he cried.  Then, like a man who
finds himself suddenly stopped, repeating, "Not
here?  To-night?"
</p>

<p>
"She went to her daughter's, before the storm
broke.  The baby is sick."
</p>

<p>
"Then Father Cary&mdash;I must have someone!"
</p>

<p>
"He is with her," said Rosamund, and made as
though she would close the door, although, if truth
be told, no power on earth would have made her do
so.  But Ogilvie stepped, still dripping, across the
threshold, while she stood before him in her dress of
thin blue, silhouetted against the lamp-light.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they faced each other, again, as
earlier on that day, their natures and all the difference
in their training and traditions ranged in opposing
forces.
</p>

<p>
The appeal of her beauty, the memory of their
hours together, swept over him like the breath of a
dream; but the doctor in him was uppermost.
</p>

<p>
"It's the Allen woman," he said.  "That boy,
six years old, came all the way to my house to tell
me.  Jim Allen is in the woods, and there's no telling
how long she's been that way.  The baby is starving;
and if I don't operate now she will die, and the baby,
too."
</p>

<p>
The words had poured out.  He barely paused,
hesitated only to give her a glance more piercing.
Yet when he spoke again he voiced a new insistence.
</p>

<p>
"I have <i>got</i> to have help.  Get on your things,"
he commanded.
</p>

<p>
"I?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you!  And quickly.  I have no time to lose."
</p>

<p>
The haste of his words only made her own seem
slower.  "Then you will certainly have to go for
someone else.  You are losing time waiting for me."
</p>

<p>
He came a step or two closer.  "You have got
to come," he said, clearly, speaking his words very
distinctly, as if trying to make himself understood
beyond question.  "There is no time to go for
someone else.  And I have got to operate on that woman
at once, <i>at once</i>, or she will die."  As Rosamund still
stood, head up, eyes upon him coldly, he repeated:
"Don't you understand?  The woman will die, and
then the baby will starve...."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes seemed to darken; Cecilia would have
recognized the sign of wrath.  "Certainly I
understand," she said.  "But you must see that it is
perfectly impossible for me&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;to help you!  I don't
know what you can be thinking of!"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible?  I say you have got to help me!  I
can't wait for anyone else!"
</p>

<p>
"I?  Help you&mdash;help you&mdash;operate&mdash;cut&mdash;oh!"
</p>

<p>
She shrank farther back towards the table.  "Oh,
I think you are perfectly brutal!"
</p>

<p>
He watched her in silence for a moment, a silence
that burned, so charged with meaning was it.  Then
he said,
</p>

<p>
"I am asking you to help me save a woman's life!"
</p>

<p>
"It would kill <i>me</i> to see it!"
</p>

<p>
He threw his hand out towards her.  "Then
live!" he cried.  "Live on, and shield your pretty
eyes from the beautiful works of the Almighty, draw
your dainty skirts aside from the contamination of
suffering humanity, cover your ears against the cries
of those little children whose mother is dying.  Dance
with your friends, laugh your life away; live for
yourself&mdash;yourself!  My God!  What kind of a thing
are you?  Do you call yourself a woman?"
</p>

<p>
He did not wait to see what effect his words
would have upon her.  He rushed across the door
sill, and the door, which he drew behind him, was
slammed by the wind as from the force of a blow.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she stood watching the door, lips
parted, eyes opened wide in horror.  It seemed as if
the blood pulsing in her throat would choke her; or
was it the wild hammering of her heart?
</p>

<p>
She looked around Mother Cary's little room as
if she had never seen it before.  Was the whole world
different, or was it only herself?  Was she still
dreaming, or was she awake?  Had he come at all, had he
called her, had he&mdash;had he thrown his bitter scorn
at her&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>

<p>
Was that the wind?  Her hand rose from her
heart to her white cheek.  Was that the voice of the
storm, or the voice of children, children&mdash;calling&mdash;crying
for&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
From her frozen horror she sprang to life.  She
ran to the room where Tim and Yetta were.  Yetta
was sitting up in bed, wide-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"What went off?" she demanded, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was already getting into her rain-coat.
"Doctor Ogilvie has been here, Yetta, and I have got
to help him.  Mrs. Allen is sick, and I have got to go."
</p>

<p>
Yetta interrupted.  "Was that him slammed the
door?  Gee!  He must a been mad about somethin'!"
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund would not be interrupted.  "Hush,
Yetta!  Listen to me!  I have got to go to
Mrs. Allen's.  Do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"My land!  If you was to meet one o' the goberlins
or one o' them fellers with their heads under their
arms, Miss Rose, you'd drop down dead with
fright!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamond remembered the absurdity of it afterwards,
but there was no time to laugh.  "Yetta!  Oh,
hush!  Listen to me!  You will not be afraid, here
with Timmy, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Land!  No!  I ain't afraid of anything when a
door's between me an' it!"
</p>

<p>
"Father Cary will be up the mountain early!"  She
turned in the door of the bed-room to look back
at the two her care had made comfortable; then she
closed it, and went out of the other door into the
storm.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
IX
</h3>

<p>
She never forgot that night.  When the door of
Mother Cary's house closed behind her, and she
faced the wind and blinding rain, she awoke.  That
was the way she always thought of it&mdash;as an awakening.
</p>

<p>
The Allen house lay beyond Father Cary's pasture;
she knew the way by day&mdash;down through the
garden, then through the woods to the rock-ribbed
clearing where the cattle were, then up, into woods
again; but in the dark it was for her but a wild,
instinctive rush, a stumbling over rock-broken ground, a
splashing through pools of water; on through the
darkness, on from one darkness to another, turning
from time to time to look back at Mother Cary's
light as a guide to direction.  Yet on she flew,
impelled by a conquering fear that drove out all lesser
fears, over rough places, through woods, up the
ascent of hills, running as much of the way as she
could, bending against the wind that seemed trying
to force her back, praying that she might find the
way, praying that she might be in time.
</p>

<p>
At last, though she could never tell how she had
come to it, a light gleamed faintly through the dark
and the rain.  At last&mdash;the Allen house!  She
tumbled to the door, paused a moment for breath, and
opened it.
</p>

<p>
It was the usual one-room cabin of the mountaineer;
there were strange, shelf-like beds against
the farthest wall, and in a corner a wooden bedstead.
It was from there that John Ogilvie looked up as she
opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!  That largest bottle&mdash;saturate
something&mdash;anything&mdash;and hold it over her face!"
</p>

<p>
She worked with him, obeying blindly, while he
struggled through the night for a woman's life, while
the poor hungry baby awoke at intervals to wail its
complaint from the other bed, while the storm shook
the house and the rain swept down unceasingly.
Once he bade her get more light.  There were no
more lamps; she knelt down on the hearth to blow
into the flame the scraps she had gathered up in her
bare hands from the wood-box; those lighted, and
lacking more, somehow she broke the box itself&mdash;a
task ordinarily as far beyond her strength as her
imagination.  It was by the light of that blaze that he
finished his work, leaving Rosamund free to do what
she could for the baby.
</p>

<p>
But, when at last there was time for speech,
neither found anything to say.  He remembered too
well the brutal words he had thrown at her a few
hours before; he could not but fear that her silence
meant that she, too, was recalling them.  He saw
her there beside the hearth, the baby on her knees;
but he saw her also in the doorway, her hair
wind-blown and wet, and her eyes wide with fear and
dread, determination and hope.  He could have grovelled
at her feet, had not her silence held him back;
but speak he could not; great emotion was always to
leave him inarticulate.
</p>

<p>
But as for Rosamund, she was unaware of his
silence or her own.  She was like a woman after her
travail, who is content to lie in silence, because the
purpose of the world has been revealed to her.
Life&mdash;that was it&mdash;to further life, to prolong it, to
minister to it!  How futile was all else!  How valueless
were the things she had been taught to value most!
Her shielded ignorance, her&mdash;her refinement&mdash;of
what use were they, when they could not face such
an emergency as last night's?  Her money, that could
have bought a hospital&mdash;what had it bought last
night, when only the service of her own two hands
could help to save a woman's life?  The pursuits of
her kind&mdash;she smiled, remembering Ogilvie's orderly
haste, as unerringly he cut, and tied and sewed, while
she as unfalteringly watched him, even assisted.  No!
For her there was nothing to say; she knew now what
life was for.  It was not the empty, useless existence
she had known.  It had a deeper meaning, a purpose
worthier its Maker.  It was wonderful beyond words.
She had nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them was aware that the dawn had
come, until someone knocked on the door.  Then
Ogilvie opened it to Father Cary, and to the
grayness of a still driving rain.
</p>

<p>
The stalwart old man stepped inside and looked
about the cabin, at the quietly breathing woman on
the bed, at Ogilvie, at Rosamund beside the fire
trying to persuade the baby to take something warm
from a spoon.
</p>

<p>
"So!" he said.  "And where's Jim Allen?"
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie threw up both his hands, hopelessly.
"Where he always is&mdash;back in the woods at one of
the stills, dead drunk, like as not."
</p>

<p>
"More'n likely," Father Cary acquiesced.  Then,
nodding towards the bed, he asked, "What's the
matter with <i>her</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing now.  She would have been dead,
though, if I had operated half an hour later.  Lord
knows how long she's been lying there.  The baby's
nearly dead, too&mdash;half-starved and half-poisoned by
his mother's illness."
</p>

<p>
"How'd you happen to come?" the old man asked.
</p>

<p>
"The oldest boy came for me&mdash;all the way over
to the Summit, and he's not six.  He's at my house
in bed now."
</p>

<p>
Then Father Cary crossed the room, and stood
beside Rosamund, looking down at her.  She met his
look with a quiet smile.
</p>

<p>
"New work for you, ain't it?" he asked.  "Ma
Cary'll be real proud o' ye!"
</p>

<p>
And answering the question in her eyes, he went
on, "Oh, she'll be home again in time to get dinner.
Wasn't nothin' the matter with the baby; but Nancy's
that nervous, an' so's Ma Cary."  He chuckled.  "I
reckon it takes some experience and a right smart
o' ca'm to be a real successful granny."
</p>

<p>
The doctor was becoming impatient.  "Will you
stay here with Miss Randall, Cary?  I must get
someone to come; she"&mdash;nodding towards the
bed&mdash;"will need watching until we can find Allen."
</p>

<p>
So for an hour or so Pa Cary sat opposite Rosamund
or busied himself preparing for breakfast the
little food to be found in the house.  The other
children awoke, tumbling down backwards from the high
box-bed, looking across at their mother with scared
faces, and distrustfully at Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
At last Ogilvie returned, bringing Grace Tobet
with him, and Rosamund was free to go home with
Father Cary.
</p>

<p>
But there must first be the inevitable moment
when she and Ogilvie should stand face to face.  It
happened simply enough.  Grace had taken Rosamund's
place beside the fire, replenished now through
Father Cary's efforts in the outer shed; the old man
had gone out for a last armful of wood, and Rosamund
was about to take down her coat from its nail
on the door.
</p>

<p>
Then, somehow, Ogilvie was standing before her.
He looked at her with trembling lips; he did not
dare to trust himself to speak.  He could only hold
out his hands.
</p>

<p>
She turned her tired face up to him, looking,
searchingly, it seemed, into his eyes.  Then, smiling,
she laid her hands for the breath of a moment in
his, and with a little gasp reached for her coat and
ran out to join Father Cary.
</p>

<p>
She was glad that Eleanor's departure, and the
rain, kept them apart for a few days after that.  She
dreaded the restraint that she thought they both must
feel when they should meet; but, when the meeting
came at last, there was no embarrassment at all.
</p>

<p>
Father Cary had left her at the Summit and she
meant to walk back to the house on the mountain,
to make the most of the first clear day after the rain.
There was a little brown house, set on the brow of
the hill overlooking the valley, almost opposite the
mountain whence Mother Cary's light shone every
night.  Rosamund had often noticed the little place,
and to-day, at the store, she had heard the men
talking about it.  The man who owned it had come from
the city a year or so before, with his wife, to be near
Doctor Ogilvie.  They were young, and the young
do not see very far ahead.  It had seemed to them in
their distress that they would have to stay there
forever; they had done many things to the little house,
and put into it many of the comforts they had been
used to.  Now the man was well, and they were going
back to the city.
</p>

<p>
"Want to sell out," the postmaster had told her.
"Humph!  Wouldn't mind sellin' out myself!  Like
to know who's going to buy prop'ty up here, this time
o' year!"
</p>

<p>
So, as she approached the little house on her way
home, Rosamund was busily thinking about it.  Perhaps,
subconsciously, the idea had been a long time
growing in her mind; but when she turned the last
bend in the road that hid the house from her view,
a plan seemed to burst upon her with all the novelty
of a revelation.  She stood still, looking first at the
house, then across the valley towards the place which
had sheltered her all summer.  She was not aware
that a vehicle drawn by a familiar white horse was
just turning out of a wood-road into the highway,
scarcely ten yards behind her.
</p>

<p>
But Ogilvie, in the sudden gladness of thus
unexpectedly coming upon her, called out.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good luck!  Let me give you a lift, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
The embarrassment that she had been dreading
was not there!  They were as simply glad to see
each other as two children; laughing, she took the
place beside him in the buggy.
</p>

<p>
He had never looked more cheerful.  "So I
caught you staring into the Marvens' windows!" he
accused her.
</p>

<p>
She laughed again.  "I am tempted to buy that
little house," she told him.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you?" he asked, lightly.  "And go
there to live, and take Timmy and Yetta with you!"  He
smiled down at her, indulgently, as at the fancies
of a child.
</p>

<p>
"That was just precisely what I was thinking of
doing," she replied.  "We could be perfectly
comfortable there during the winter.  I don't want to
go back to town one bit!"
</p>

<p>
"So you could," he agreed, still in his bantering
tone.  "And I wouldn't stop with Tim and Yetta.
I'd take in a few more.  You might borrow some
little Allens, or get someone to lend you an orphan
asylum."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund put her head back and laughed aloud,
merrily.  "But I am perfectly in earnest!" she cried;
and was, from that moment.
</p>

<p>
But if the doctor refused to take the idea
seriously, it was quite otherwise with Mother Cary.
When Rosamund disclosed to her the half-formed
plan&mdash;she had come to discuss nearly everything with
that fount of human wisdom&mdash;the dear soul did not
seem surprised at all, but at once made a thoroughly
feminine mental leap into the very middle of arrangements.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, dearie, it will be just splendid!
And you won't need so very many furnishin's.
There's some cheers up in our loft you might take,
and you can have things up from the city.  Yetta's
learned a good deal this summer.  I can bake for you
for a while, till the child gets more used to the work,
and I reckon you can manage the rest of it betwixt you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose," Rosamund asked, "that
Grace Tobet would come, too?"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary sat down in her little low rocking
chair, and laid her crutch on the brick floor of the
front walk, always a sign of her settling down for a
real talk.  Things had been going worse and worse
with the Tobets; Rosamund and Yetta went down
almost daily, but beyond their friendly visits there
seemed little they could do.  The Government's
suspicions were centering on Joe, the big, born leader of
rough elements, and on his band of four or five other
men, who would follow him to death or worse.  Jim
Allen was one; but now, repentant and sobered by the
baby's death, he was at home nursing his wife.  Grace
had sped through the woods in the night to warn Joe
and his followers more than once; yet even to
Ogilvie she denied any knowledge of Joe's business.
</p>

<p>
"It's squirrels he's after," she said, "and sometimes
drink; all this talk of moonshine's jest foolishness.
I'd know it ef 'twas so.  It ain't so!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mrs. Tobet," the doctor replied, "your
squirrel stew would not be to my liking!  Better keep
the lid on the pot while it's cooking!"
</p>

<p>
He saw too many evidences of the moonshine's
work to believe her; but he had seen Joe Tobet come
home, and he honored Grace, too familiar with
human nature to marvel at her faithfulness.  Mother
Cary alone knew all that Grace Tobet knew; all
secrets were safe in her kind old heart, and even from
Pap she hid this one, for Father Cary was not one of
those who hold councils of compromise with the Evil
One.  Therefore, when Rosamund suggested Grace
Tobet, Mother Cary sat down to think it out.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes' silent pondering, she said,
"Honey, I've never been one to advise the partin' of
husband and wife!  Howsomever, if there's any good
left in Joe Tobet, it may be the surest way o' bringin'
him back to straight ways o' livin', ef we can coax
Grace to leave him for a while."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can't give a thought to Joe's
salvation," Rosamund declared.  "But Grace&mdash;oh, she's
too fine to be left there!  I should like to give her one
winter of comfort!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you haven't got a holt of her yet,"
Mother Cary reminded her, "an' it wouldn't be but
half comfort for her, the outside half, anyways, away
from her man.  But I can't see what anybody could do
better than to keep little Tim and Yetta up here out
o' harm's way, and maybe save Grace Tobet an' Joe,
too.  Land's sake, dearie, you must be quite well off!"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to come to Mother Cary suddenly, and
was the first spark of curiosity Rosamund had ever
known her to show.  Until now her wisdom had
seemed all-embracing; but that a young woman, that
Rosamund, who had lived so quietly in her house all
summer, could carry out a suddenly formed plan of
buying a house and sheltering three people&mdash;this was
evidently quite outside of her experience.  She looked
up with unwonted surprise in her face.  Rosamund
bent and kissed the wrinkled pink cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear Mother Cary," she said, "I am so
well off that I could probably buy every house at the
Summit, and build as many more!  I am so well off
that I have never in all my life, until this summer,
had a chance to find out how well off I am!  I am so
well off that I did not know how poor I have been,
nor how much people can need the wretched mere
money, nor how very, very little it can really do!
I have only begun to find out what life is made of,
and so I'm not well off at all!"
</p>

<p>
Tears came into her eyes as she spoke, and she
turned her head away; but Mother Cary's hand was
stretched towards her, instantly.  Presently she said,
in the low tone which was the tenderest and sweetest
of all:
</p>

<p>
"Dearie child, when the young folks come an'
tell me things like you're tellin' me now, I reckon
there ain't anybody in the world as well off as me!
An' I'll tell you jest what it is makes you do it&mdash;it's
because I'm so happy!  An' I'll tell you jest what
makes me so happy.  I let Pap take keer o' me, an'
I try to take keer o' him an' jest as many other folks
as I can!  That's the whole of it!"  After a pause
she added, "You're goin' to do jest the same as me,
both in keering for someone, an' in bein' took keer of!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's eyes opened wide; she paled a little
and pressed her hand against her trembling lips.  "I
don't know," she whispered.  "I'm afraid!  Oh, I'm
afraid!"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary patted the hand she held, and knew
too much to speak.  Their thoughts, in the silence,
wandered far; came back and dwelt upon the things
that were, the things to be; there is no way of knowing
whether they went hand in hand, but after a while
Mother Cary said:
</p>

<p>
"Dearie, I wouldn't tell him, if I was you,
about&mdash;about all you have, the money an'&mdash;you
know!&mdash;I wouldn't tell the doctor yet a while!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund drew her breath sharply, and her face
flamed; she was too startled to answer, but in a
moment she left her place on the bench and knelt beside
the old woman, hiding her face on the knees where
so many had found comfort.  Mother Cary smoothed
her hair, and after a while began to talk, almost as
if to herself.
</p>

<p>
"There's a friend o' mine sometimes spends her
summers up around here; she's married to a eye
doctor&mdash;that's how come Yetta got sent up here to me.
Her husband knew Doctor Ogilvie down in the city.
She told me there never was one they thought more
of, down there; they said he found out more about
nerves than anybody else in the world, and he used
to work day and night and in between times, trying
to discover more.  They said there never was such a
one with little child'en; he could almost make 'em
over new, seemed like.  They said he never cared
whether folks could pay him or not for what he did&mdash;all
he cared for was the curin' of 'em.  I can well
believe it, too, for many's the time I see him almost
starved without knowin' what's the matter with him,
and he ain't a mite particler about his clo'es.  Well,
he worked an' he worked; and one day my friend's
husband, that was one o' his friends, went into his
little room where he kept his bottles and things, and
found him layin' on the floor.  They thought he
surely would die, but praise the Lord, that wasn't to
be; only, he had to give up his work down in the big
horspital.  I often think on what that must 'a' been
to him.  I reckon it must 'a' been worse than it would
be for Pap to give up a raisin' them white hogs o'
his he's so proud of.  Anyway, he come up here, an'
he got well!  And now he says he hasn't got time to
go back there again&mdash;there's too much for him to do
up here all the time.  So he jest rides around the
country with that Rosy horse.  Somebody asked him
once why he didn't buy an automobile.  He said for
one thing he hadn't the money for it; and for another,
he needed White Rosy to remind him where he was
going!"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary stopped to laugh; Rosamund raised
her head, with an answering smile that was half tears.
</p>

<p>
"Land sakes," Mother Cary went on, "I do believe
if it wasn't for Rosy he'd sometimes forget to
come home!  When they get to one o' the houses
where he visits, Rosy stops and turns her head around;
ef he don't say anything to her, there she stands; but
if he tells her he don't have to get out there that day,
Rosy jogs along to the next place!  I'm real fond o'
humans, but sometimes I do wish't they all knew as
much as the doctor's Rosy!"
</p>

<p>
This time Rosamund joined in the laugh.  But the
old woman had more to tell.  "Time was when I
might 'a' wondered how come he stays on here, him
bein' the great doctor he is; but I'm so old now that
I know too much to wonder about anything any more!
There's folks in this world that never can find any
work to do, and there's folks that makes work for
themselves, and then again there's folks that are so
busy with the work right at hand that they never get
time to find out whether they're workin' or not.
That's Doctor Ogilvie's kind.  He's so busy workin'
up here in the mountings, that he never stops to think
about whether he is doing the work he likes best or
not; it's just work he has to do, because it's here to
be done, and that's all there is to it for him.  He
works so hard at it, inside his own head, that he
forgets most everything else.  Land, I remember the
time he sat up with me all night long, workin' over
Milly Grate's baby that had the membranious
croup&mdash;dipthery, he called it.  Come mornin', an' he told
Milly the baby'd get well, he suddenly went out and
sat right down on the doorstep; come to find out, he'd
brought two babies into the world the day before and
driven twenty-two miles and walked about a dozen&mdash;and
forgotten to take a bite to eat!  Another time,
somebody sent a little boy over the mounting for him
in a hurry; he was at a house where a man had broke
his leg, and White Rosy was waitin' for him at the
gate; but when he heard how bad off the little girl
was he'd been sent for, didn't he jest set out and run
all the way there, forgettin' that there was such a
thing as a wagon to ride in, and White Rosy still
a waitin'!
</p>

<p>
"And he boards with the Widder Speers, where
it ain't likely she can make him very comfortable, she
bein' well past eighty; but he found out soon after
he come up here that she would have to be moved
to&mdash;the place where nobody likes to go!&mdash;she not
having any support; so he boards there, an' she doesn't
have to leave her home, that her husband built for
her when they was married, and where her only son
died.  You might hunt the world over, honey-bird,
without findin' any better man than Doctor Ogilvie!
But, somehow or other, ef I was you, I wouldn't let
on to him that I had as much money as you say you
have.  Money's a dreadful stumblin'-block to some
people!  And you never can tell which way men
folks'll jump!"
</p>

<p>
It had been long since Rosamund, trained in
self-control as she had been, was so keenly aware of
intense embarrassment.  Her first impulse was to feel
affront at Mother Cary's taking so much for granted
in her relations with the doctor; but no one could
really be angry with Mother Cary.  She was abashed
that the old woman had divined more than she herself
had been aware of; and then there arose the doubt
that she had so often felt of the doctor's personal
interest in herself or her affairs.  She yielded to the
maiden's inevitable longing for reassurance.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think," she whispered, her
cheek against Mother Cary's hand, "what makes you
think that he&mdash;would be&mdash;interested?"
</p>

<p>
"Darlin'!" Mother Cary cried, "John Ogilvie
thinks a heap o' you&mdash;but he ain't got hardly a
suspicion of it yet&mdash;any more than you know how much
you're goin' to care for him!"
</p>

<p>
Then, with the usual coincidence, the object of
their talk came into view, driving White Rosy toward
the little green gate, Yetta on one side of him and
Tim on the other; they waved to the two in front of
the house, but Rosamund sprang to her feet and fled
indoors.
</p>

<h3>
X
</h3>

<p>
Rosamund awoke the next morning with her
mind joyously full of her new plans; but it was
little Tim who suggested that which crowned them.
Tim was always the first member of the household,
after Father Cary, to go out of doors in the mornings;
to-day he brought back a tight handful of stemless
blossoms to present to Rosamund.  Dewy and
rosy-cheeked, he had never before appeared as much the
baby as on this morning, standing in front of her
with his feet apart, holding up his floral offering.
</p>

<p>
"It was all ve pretty flowers 'at was awake," he
announced.  "Here&mdash;I 'ikes you!"
</p>

<p>
"Land!  I hope he ain't been in my geraniums!"
said Mother Cary, from the stove; but Rosamund
grasped the chubby hand, with its blossoms, and
kissed it.
</p>

<p>
"They are beautiful, Tim!  I 'ike you, too!  And
Tim, how would you like to live with me all the
time?"
</p>

<p>
He stared at her for a moment.  "Oh!  O-o-oh!
Is you gonin' to 'dopt me?"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary, with an exclamation, turned quickly
to watch the two; Rosamund met her eyes over the
boy's head.  Her plan was coming to birth.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to, Tim?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
The child's lips began to quiver.  Then he dumped
himself down upon the floor, and howled.  "Want
my White Lady!" he cried.  "Want to 'dopt my
White Lady!"
</p>

<p>
Swiftly he was lifted in Rosamund's arms.
"Good for you, Tim!  Good for you, old man!  I'm
glad you know your own mind!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
She gathered him up, threw herself into a big
rocking chair, set him astride on her knees and rocked
him wildly back and forth, down until his curls nearly
touched the floor, then up again, up in a bubble of
laughter and kisses, Timmy forgetting his tears to
shout with glee, down and up again, down and up,
the child screaming with joy.  Father Cary and
Yetta coming in from the barn to breakfast, stood in
the doorway laughing, Yetta wondering a little at
Miss Rose's unwonted exuberance.  Mother Cary had
already taken her place at the table, and was laughing
in sympathy with them.
</p>

<p>
When Rosamund stopped, breathless, with aching
arms, Tim still demanded "More!  More! do it
'den!"
</p>

<p>
"Land's sakes, honey-bird, what ails ye?"
Mother Cary cried.  "I never suspected you <i>could</i>
be so lively!"
</p>

<p>
For reply Rosamund looked at Yetta.  "When
Tim adopts the 'White Lady,' and I go to live with
them, will you come, too, Yetta?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Is that a conundrum?  I ain't much good at
riddles!" Yetta declared.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed; she would have laughed at
anything to-day.  "Not a riddle&mdash;an answer, Yetta!
You and Timmy, Mrs. Reeves and I, are all going to
live together in the brown house at the Summit!
What do you think of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Sho', now!  That's the very ticket!" said
Mother Cary.  "How come you didn't think o' Mis'
Reeves yesterday, lamb?  But&mdash;ain't she held by that
Mis' Hetherbee?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she is; but I think we can persuade
Mrs. Hetherbee to let her come."
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  I'd be glad to get away from that old
one, if 'twas me!" said Yetta, in an aside which the
others thought best to ignore.
</p>

<p>
"Pap," said Mother Cary, "if so be you'll put
the harness on Ben, Miss Rose and me'll drive over
an' begin cleanin' the house this mornin'!"
</p>

<p>
The old man put down his knife and fork, looked
from his wife to Miss Randall, and back again.  "It
do beat all how you women-folks jump into the
middle o' things the minute you get started," he said.
"The house ain't even empty yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Land, I forgot all about them Marvens," said
Mother Cary.  "No matter!  It gives us all the more
time to get good an' ready, honey-bird!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund very soon began to realize that she
needed time.  First of all, she sent for her man of
business, an excellent person who lacked imagination,
and was later found to disapprove of purchases of
little brown houses or of anything else that could
never bring interest or increase in value.  But his
disapproval of that investment was as nothing to the
objections he made to another.  It was not until
Rosamund reminded him that her twenty-fifth birthday
had come and gone, releasing the Randall property
from all trust and making it now her own, and
declared that if he refused to obey her directions she
would be obliged to ask someone else to look after
her interests, that he reluctantly consented to it.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the delicate matter of bringing
Eleanor to consent to her plans.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
DARLING ELEANOR [she wrote]: I have decided
that Timmy must be adopted.  I make the announcement
first of all, because I know that if I did not
mention him at once, you would skip all the first part of
my letter until you found his name, and only read on
from there.  And I have a proposition which needs
to be presented right end foremost.  So&mdash;Tim <i>must</i>
be adopted.  He has his heart set upon it; and he has
turned out to be such a darling little boy.  He cannot
be sent back to the Charities, to be looked over and
refused by people who would not appreciate him,
anyway.  Doctor Ogilvie says that he must stay here
another year, if he is to be made entirely well; but
unless he has the best of care after that, and is made
happy, he will not live to be the good and useful man
we should like to see him.  Doctor Ogilvie is a great
believer in the curative powers of happiness; and you
know he is a very good doctor.  Well&mdash;I have
already made over to Tim some money, to be held in
trust for him until he is twenty-five.  The entire
interest is to be given, until said time, to the adopted
parent of said Tim, according to said agreement, for
the use and maintenance of said parent and said
Tim, the entire amount to be paid over to him
twenty-one years after the execution of the deed of
trust.  I do hope you are properly impressed by that
legal phraseology, Eleanor darling.  I put in all the
'saids' I could, just as the lawyers do.  I want you to
see what a fine and wonderful thing it is for Timmy,
Timmy the waif, to be the subject of anything so
impressive; and the sum of money I have given him
will provide simple comfort for him and his
parent-by-adoption; only, of course, I must be sure that his
parent is a person whom I can trust to spend it as it
should be spent, and so to bring up the boy that he
will be worthy of his&mdash;let's call it his inheritance&mdash;when
he finally receives it.  So it has all been done
subject to one condition.  Unless that condition should
be fulfilled, the child will have to go back to the
Charities; I had a great discussion about it all with
Mr. Leeds, my lawyer; and he only consented to draw
up the paper subject to that condition.  It is that&mdash;oh,
Eleanor, don't say 'no'!&mdash;it is that you will adopt
little Tim, let him fill that empty place in your heart,
teach him to be a good man, and&mdash;I shall spoil it if I
write another word, dear White Lady, sweet White
Lady, White Lady that Timmy loves!  See this blur,
Eleanor&mdash;it is where he has pressed a kiss, to send to
his White Lady.  R.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To this Eleanor replied, "I have your letter.  I
must think."  Rosamund tried to be satisfied with
that for a while; but as the days passed and Eleanor
wrote nothing more, and as Cecilia must be persuaded
and her trustees interviewed, she sent her sister a night
letter, begging her to join her in New York immediately.
She told Ogilvie and the others that she was
going to buy furniture for the house, which was true
enough.
</p>

<p>
There was that in the interview with the lawyers
that put Cecilia into a most complaisant state of
mind; when she thought of Rosamund's having put
the greater part of the Randall income at her disposal
she could not find it in her heart to show disapproval
of anything else that Rosamund might choose to do.
The only protest she made was at the gift to the
little waif.
</p>

<p>
"Pure Quixotism, my dear, never gains you a
thing.  It is the most utter madness I ever heard of."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it will gain Timmy something, and
Eleanor something; and you know very well, Cecilia,
that I shall never miss it."
</p>

<p>
"We won't discuss it," Cecilia said, "but I am
sure that not even Colonel Randall would have done
anything so wildly impulsive."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund could find very little to say to that;
she knew well enough that nothing but her faith in
Eleanor could make it seem anything but a hazardous
experiment.  Mother Cary had seen nothing but good
in the plan, but here in New York idealism seemed
out of place; what had appeared fine there looked
foolish here.  She was beginning to doubt the
excellence of her plan, when word came from Eleanor that
Mrs. Hetherbee was back in town.  Rosamund called
at once, presenting Cecilia's cards with her own, as
the first move in the little social campaign that she
foresaw.  Eleanor, in her white gown, looked strangely
out of place in Mrs. Hetherbee's florid apartment that
overlooked the Hudson, and had every splendor
known to apartments, even to an up-and-down-stairs
of its own.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor kissed her, then held her off for a long
look.
</p>

<p>
"Rose, Rose!  How can you tempt me so?" she
cried.  "It is only a scheme for giving the money
to me!"
</p>

<p>
"Eleanor, tell me the truth.  Did you and Tim
fall in love with each other at first sight, or not?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Little Tim!"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely!  Little Tim!  Would you deprive
him of such an opportunity as this?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you would never take the money away from
him, Rose&mdash;now?"
</p>

<p>
"But it is not his, yet!  It never can be, unless
you will take him for your son&mdash;for your own little
boy, Eleanor!  Think of it!"
</p>

<p>
"I do think of it!  I haven't thought of anything
else."
</p>

<p>
"Except, my dear, that you, too, will benefit by
the plan!  So you are trying to refuse.  Don't be
selfish, Eleanor!"
</p>

<p>
"Selfish?  To deny myself what I want most in
the world?"
</p>

<p>
"You and Tim seem to know your own minds!
When I asked him if <i>I</i> should adopt him, he plumped
down on the floor and yelled for his White Lady."
</p>

<p>
"Rose!  Don't make it so hard!"
</p>

<p>
"It is you who are making it hard!  I have
grown very fond of Timmy, and I should hate, just
hate to see him go back to the Charities.  Think of
the poor mite being scrubbed up and dressed in a
clean striped gingham, and brought out to be
inspected by possible adopters!  Think how he will feel
when they say, 'Oh, I don't think we want a little
boy with hip disease!' or 'Haven't you any&mdash;er&mdash;prettier
children?'
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Rose!"  Eleanor put her hands over her
eyes, while Rosamund drew her down to one of
Mrs. Hetherbee's Louis Quinze settees.
</p>

<p>
"Eleanor," she said, seriously, "let us admit, if
you want to, that I am giving the money to you.  Of
course it will be practically your own until you have
had Tim twenty-one years.  I have such faith in what
you will do with him that I give the whole amount to
Tim, outright, after then.  I have such faith in the
son he will be to you, that I am willing to let him
have the joy of taking care of his mother after that
time.  Do you suppose I would give him money, if
he were going to a stranger?  Cecilia calls me Quixotic,
but I assure you I am not as far gone as all that."
Eleanor was weakening.  "It is a great deal of
money, Rosamund," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if that's all that's troubling you!  It does
not seem much to me.  Besides, I owe the world
something!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  Eleanor put her hand to the girl's cheek,
turning her face until she could look into her eyes.
"Rose, what else has the summer taught you?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's eyes widened a little.  "We have
no time to talk of that now while Timmy is waiting
for his mother!"
</p>

<p>
"His mother!  Oh, how you tempt me, Rose!"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Eleanor!  I have bought that little house
at the Summit that the Marvens lived in.  Mr. Marven
is cured, and they have gone back to the city.  I
am going to live in it this winter, with you and Tim
and Yetta; I have already sent down to Augusta for
my old Mammy Susan and her husband, Matt, to
meet me there two weeks from now.  The Charities
will not let you or me or anyone else adopt Timmy
without a year's probation first.  Come with me for
this winter, and see how we all feel about it when the
year is out.  Come as my housekeeper.  Put away
your selfish pride, White Lady&mdash;and let your salary
be what Timmy's interest would be if you had already
adopted him.  A year will help us all to wisdom perhaps."
</p>

<p>
Eleanor, with head bent, and hands clasped in her
lap, thought for a long moment.
</p>

<p>
"I am asking you to take too much responsibility
upon yourself, I suppose!" Rosamund said at last,
slyly watching her friend.  Eleanor turned at once,
swift to deny.
</p>

<p>
"How can you insinuate such a thing!  Are they
open, at the Charities building, in the afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund threw her arms about the White
Lady's neck in a half-strangling embrace.  "You
darling!  Yes, we will go there at once!  I told them
we'd be there this afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
"Rose!" Eleanor cried.  "How could you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I knew you could never in the world send
Tim back to them!"
</p>

<p>
They forgot Mrs. Hetherbee until they had
signed the provisional papers of adoption for the
child, and were on their way uptown in Cecilia's new
limousine, which she had loaned Rosamund for the
afternoon.  It was disconcerting to find that
Mrs. Hetherbee had no intention of releasing Eleanor; but
Cecilia allowed herself to be persuaded to join in the
campaign.  When at last Cecilia sent for a society
reporter who had never before succeeded in penetrating
to her, and gave out the interesting item that she
was to dine, <i>en famille</i>, with Mrs. Hetherbee on the
twenty-second, the little lady capitulated, even
adding her blessing.
</p>

<p>
To Cecilia, admiration was an incense always
acceptable; Mrs. Hetherbee amused her, and one had
to do something to amuse one's self.  There was
nothing exciting in Rosamund's shopping expeditions.  The
city might have been deserted, so few of their own
friends were in town.  Some lingered at their country
places, others were in Lenox for the hunting, or still
abroad.  The effect of New York's social emptiness
was to draw more closely together than was possible
during the busier season the comparative few who for
one reason or another were in town.  There was more
time for lunching together and going afterwards for a
spin toward the Westchester hills or over to one of
the Long Island golf courses; and for one of the
week-ends, which were torrid with the humidity of
late September, they stood out to sea aboard one of
the steam yachts that were beginning to bring their
owners back to the North River.  Sometimes a longing
for her mountains would sweep so strongly over
Rosamund that she would have a sense of unreality,
as if she were in a strange land, among strange
people, instead of having just returned to the familiar
noise and glitter of New York.
</p>

<p>
One morning, when they had been shopping about
for things that refused to be discovered, and clothes
which should be simple enough for the brown house,
and Cecilia had refused to go farther until she had
had something to eat, they went to their favorite
lunching place, now curiously deserted except by
people who seemed to have come from another world,
who spoke in strange accents and stared about them
as if still under the spell of the man with the
megaphone.  In a corner of the overdecorated room near
a window which was still shielded by awning and
window boxes from the Avenue's glare, Cecilia sank
back, weary, and frankly out of sorts with everything.
</p>

<p>
"It is a most horrible time of year for shopping,"
she said, after she had ordered their luncheon with
great precision.  "There is not a thing left in the
shops.  I wonder what they do with the clothes that
were left over?  Does somebody wear them, or do
they just throw them out, or what?  Or is it because
you are hunting for such queer things, Rosamund?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed.  "But they won't be queer
in the mountains, Cecilia," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad I shall not have to look at them,"
Mrs. Maxwell replied.  "But if you are going to do
the peculiar, I suppose you may as well be consistently
peculiar all the way along.  Only, don't expect me
to like it, nor approve of it; and don't think I'm
encouraging you in it.  I am going about with you
because someone has to; I think you are foolish, <i>very</i>,
and I really do <i>NOT</i> believe even Colonel Randall
would have approved of your going off like this!"
</p>

<p>
Hunger and fatigue had worn on poor Cecilia's
nerves; but if she had dreamed of having any other
audience than her sister, the scolding would have been
subdued.  Flood and Pendleton, finishing their luncheon
in a distant corner, had seen the two and made
their ways towards them.  The sharpness of Cecilia's
tone seemed to amuse Marshall.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, Cecilia," he said, so close behind her
that she fairly jumped, while Rosamund smiled,
"what's going off?"
</p>

<p>
Cecilia's eyes looked dangerous, and Flood,
laughing, came to the rescue.  "Come off with us,
won't you?" he asked, so genially that for the first
time Rosamund felt some warmth of response to his
smile.  "We thought of running up Westchester way
for the afternoon; won't you come with us?"
</p>

<p>
His lover's quick perception told him that Rosamund
was not averse to the interruption of the <i>tête-à-tête</i>,
and he looked at her rather than at Cecilia for
response.  "There's a bit of woods back of Pocantico
that always reminds me of those Virginia places where
the leaves remain pale green, and the sunlight comes
through and touches the ferns; you know!"
</p>

<p>
His own eloquence rather abashed him; but Rosamund's
tired face flushed; his words recalled to her
the very scent of the woods; suddenly, there
overlooking the Avenue, amid the vibrating undertone of
noises, in the place of all others where the wealth of
the metropolis and its cosmopolitanism that is unlike
any other cosmopolitanism manifests itself most
impressively, she was homesick for the mountains and
her friends there.  She could have cried out with
longing; and Flood's offer of a glimpse of woods
was to her what the blossom is to the man in a hospital.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" she said, leaning towards him with a
little air of eagerness.  "Oh, yes, do take us!  I'd
rather get out to the woods than do anything else in
the world this afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
Flood's face reddened deeply with the satisfaction
of having scored at last.  He and Pendleton
drew up chairs and chatted while the two women
disposed of their skillfully combined luncheons.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Flood, make her promise not to desert us
again," cried Pendleton.
</p>

<p>
"It is rather brave of you, Marshall, to talk
about desertions!" Cecilia remarked.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton grinned.  "I haven't deserted you, Cecilia,"
he said.  "I retreated!  You know I'm afraid
of you, Cecilia, when you're in a temper."
</p>

<p>
Flood was beginning to look distressed, but
Rosamund smiled at him.  "Let them squabble,
Mr. Flood!  I want to tell you about Timmy!"
</p>

<p>
Flood's look brightened.  "Ah!  The little chap
we bumped into!  Yes!  And do tell me about
Ogilvie.  Didn't you find him a good fellow?"
</p>

<p>
She told him of her plans for the child and for
her winter; Flood listened, saying little.  It put him
to shame that she should be doing everything for the
two waifs, but her doing so only set her on a higher
throne in the heaven of his longing.  So intent was
he on listening to every word, catching every intonation,
watching every fleeting expression, that he was
unaware of her not answering his question about
Ogilvie.
</p>

<p>
At last Flood was driving his own car northward
out of the city.  A hope that fortune would continue
further to smile upon him had prompted his asking a
third man, who came up to speak to them, to join
their party, so that he could release his chauffeur for
the afternoon; and it was either an undefined wish
to be rid of Cecilia for a few hours, or else a latent
sense of gratitude, which prompted Rosamund to
take her place beside him, smiling divinely&mdash;or so he
fondly thought&mdash;at him, and roguishly at Cecilia and
her attendant swains.  Cecilia thoroughly enjoyed
having two men to herself, especially as Marshall had
been none too faithful since their parting in Virginia,
and the situation offered an opportunity for discipline.
The third man was benignly unaware of complications,
and Rosamund openly laughed at Pendleton's
expression of disgust.
</p>

<p>
They had passed out of the place side by side,
while Flood went ahead to see to the car.  "What's
the matter with its little nose?" Rosamund laughed
at Pendleton.  "All out of joint?"
</p>

<p>
"You are perfectly disgusting, Rosamund," he
replied in a most matter-of-fact tone, quite as if he
were saying the sun was warm or the car was there.
"Your manners have become contaminated, and your
complexion has suffered, and you are a most disagreeable
person.  I hope you'll be stout before you are
thirty!  There!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's laugh was so frankly merry that Cecilia
turned on a quick impulse of repression.  Rosamund
ought to know better than to laugh aloud in the
door of a restaurant!  But Flood was beside them,
the other man might misunderstand a sisterly
admonition, and Pendleton's raised eyebrows of disgust
quite satisfied her.  She allowed herself to be helped
into the tonneau, happy in her own situation.
</p>

<p>
Flood knew better than to attempt small talk; he
divined that he could better make himself felt by
saying nothing than by saying the wrong thing.  They
passed swiftly northward out of the city, following
upland roads that gave enchanting glimpses of the
river and of nearer gardens; after an hour or so he
brought his car to slow speed.  They were beyond
Sleepy Hollow, in woods of new growth, ferny
depths, scarcely touched by sunlight, roadsides where
pale asters set themselves like stars.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it like Virginia?" Flood asked.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund only nodded; but presently she almost
whispered, "I love it!  Oh, I love it!"
</p>

<p>
"You are really going to spend the winter
there?" Flood asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she told him.  "It somehow seems like
home to me."
</p>

<p>
He knew that he must move carefully into her
thoughts.  "I understand how that can be," he said,
after a pause.  "There was a place in Idaho that
used to make me choke every time I passed it; I never
knew why, until one day an English fellow happened
to say as we rode by, 'Jove, there must be trout in
that brook!'  Then I knew it made me homesick,
because every boy has something in him that makes
him want to fish.  I had wanted to, worst sort, when
I was a youngster&mdash;though I was born in an inland
city, and never had a chance to.  It just made me
homesick for the boyhood I ought to have had!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund looked at him in amazement.  Subtlety
and imagination from Flood she had never foreseen;
her own imagination was fired at once, and her
face flushed a little with shame at what she had
thought of him before.  Flood looked straight ahead,
but he was more keenly aware of the girl beside him
than she of him.  His heart was pounding as if he
were setting out on a race; and indeed he beheld a
stake before him as clearly as ever in his life.  She
answered, and he knew that he had scored; at last he
had made her aware of him!
</p>

<p>
So well had they progressed by the time they had
got back to town that he felt he could dare to say,
before he left her, "I want to know those Maryland
and Virginia woods of yours better, myself."
</p>

<p>
He wondered afterwards whether he had said too much.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
XI
</h3>

<p>
After the Westchester afternoon there were two
dinners with Flood as host; and do what she
would, she could not altogether escape his daily,
almost hourly attentions, without wounding his feelings
and her own.  He did nothing she might not accept
without in the least seeming to bind herself by any
obligation; the very intensity of his love urged him to
caution.  But when he suggested to Cecilia that, since
her sister had decided to go down by train, he should
perhaps be going as far as Washington on the same
day, he would have divined Cecilia better if he had
not been so absorbed in his dreams of Rosamund; for
Mrs. Maxwell's ambitions had enlarged since early
summer, and she did not hesitate to divulge his plan.
Rosamund was to have taken the Congressional; instead,
she slipped away at nine o'clock; so anxious was
she to put distance between herself and Flood, that
she would not even wait for Eleanor.
</p>

<p>
On the way down, she wondered at something in
Cecilia's expression when she had made known her
intention of running away from Flood's companionship,
but there was too much else in her mind to permit of
her spending much thought upon those she had just
left; there was a warmth in her heart as of the traveler's
returning to the land of his affection.  She had
called New York her home for most of her life, and
lived in the mountains three months; yet behind her
she left little that she loved, and before her lay
smiling fields of imagination; and she found the vision
sweet.  She planned the placing of the furniture in
the little house, made out a list of the things that
should go in each room, and wondered what she had
forgotten.  She was carrying little presents back with
her, and she took them out of her bag, opened their
boxes to make sure they were quite right, put them
back into their wrappings, and with the pencil on her
chatelaine wrote messages on each.  Only for Ogilvie
she had no gift; she had spent more time in hunting
something for him than in choosing her dining-room
furniture, and had come away with&mdash;nothing!  There
was really nothing in all New York that she could
take back to the doctor!
</p>

<p>
When he met her at the little station in the October
darkness of early evening, she looked about for
Yetta and Tim.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you would bring the children to welcome
me!" she exclaimed, and was glad that she had
it to say.
</p>

<p>
But the doctor, who was walking beside her with
her small hand bag, only said, quietly, "No, you
didn't!" and Rosamund's cheeks burned as he helped
her to her place behind White Rosy.
</p>

<p>
He asked her about her days in the city, but she
had little to say of them; what interested her now was
the new home she was going to make.  As they
approached it she peered through the darkness at the
little brown cottage, and they stopped for a moment
to make sure that Mother Cary's light could be seen
from there.  She told him that Mrs. Reeves was going
to be with her, and that she had arranged with
the Charities to keep Timmy for a while longer; of
the possible adoption she said nothing, having bound
Eleanor also to silence, ignoring the question in his
eyes.  When she spoke of her hope of having Grace
live with them, the doctor's face became grave.
</p>

<p>
"It would be the best thing in the world for
Grace, in one way, and perhaps for you; but&mdash;I am
not thinking of anything specific&mdash;but Joe Tobet, if
angered, might be a dangerous enemy.  If he should
resent Grace's defection, and blame it on you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed.  "Oh, but I am not in the
least afraid of any Joe Tobets, you know!" she said.
"What on earth could he do to me?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you mean what could a man of his
class do to injure a woman of yours?"
</p>

<p>
Her face flushed a little.  "Well, what if I do?"
</p>

<p>
"I think you'd find that he is unaware of class
distinctions.  He certainly would not regard them.
He might be vindictive; he might make all sorts of
trouble for you, and is sure to for Grace."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that's just the point!  I want to
protect her from him!"
</p>

<p>
"It is not your place to!"  But then he turned
towards her, and she knew he smiled through the
darkness.  "Play Lady Bountiful, if you will, but do
take my advice and let poor Grace work out her own
salvation."
</p>

<p>
She had no answering smile.  "Oh," she said,
"I thought you were above such phrases."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I thought so, too; but I'm not above
anything when it's a question of danger to&mdash;you."
</p>

<p>
The slight deepening of his tone was enough to
make her hold her breath; but she would not let emotion
affect her desire to make her intention clear to him.
</p>

<p>
"I do not believe there is any danger," she said,
"but if there is I think I cannot regard it.  I&mdash;I am
not sure I can make you understand&mdash;but I want to!
It is not just an idle whim that makes me stay here
this winter; it is not because I am tired of other
things, things I've always had.  I have been restless,
I confess, but it is not restlessness that has made me
decide to stay here.  I have no theories of life.  I'm
afraid I've rather scorned the people who have; but
somehow I know that I have something to do here.
I cherish the belief that I have.  I have never had
any special thing to do, before, you see!  So even if
I knew that there was danger in my living in that
little brown house, and having poor Grace with me, I
should ignore the danger, because&mdash;well, because
there is something for me to do here, and I am going
to try to do it."
</p>

<p>
They were down in the valley by this time,
Mother Cary's lamp twinkling far above them; there
was light enough from the starlit sky for her to see
that he had taken off his old cap, worn out of deference
to her arrival, and that he ran his fingers backward
through his hair, as always when he was troubled.
He did not reply until they turned into the
shadow of the wooded road and Rosy was climbing
the last half mile of their drive.
</p>

<p>
"God knows, there's work a-plenty for every
comer," he said.  "It is not for me to tell you to
keep out of it.  But I hadn't thought of it in that
way&mdash;for you."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I ought to tell you," she said, "that I
can help in another way.  I have heard Mother Cary
talk about the people farther back in the mountains&mdash;the
people you see, but that only come out, she says,
when the 'summer folks' are gone.  Grace has told
me about them, too.  I&mdash;I have some money at my
disposal&mdash;I know where I can get a good deal.  I
thought perhaps you might&mdash;and Grace&mdash;use it in
some way&mdash;you would know how, wouldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
The thought of her deception, if such it was, made
her hesitate in her speech; but her disappointment was
quick and keen that he did not at once accept her
suggestion.  When at last he spoke, his voice sounded
tired, and she did not understand his answer until she
had pondered it that night in her own room at Mother
Cary's.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid," he said, "that even with what
you think is a good deal, we should need another
miracle of the loaves and fishes."

<h3>
XII
</h3>

<p>
In the weeks before they moved into the cottage,
there were moments when life presented itself to
Rosamund in more difficult guise than she had
dreamed it ever wore.  Hitherto, it had been easy
enough for her to take up her abode in one place or
another, as fancy led her; in New York, in Georgia,
in Europe, there were always people to smooth the
way&mdash;servants to make everything ready and comfortable,
mother or sister or one person or another to set
in motion the many wheels of the household clockwork.
She had never given a thought to the machinery
of life; it had seemed as simple as to breathe the
free air.  Not even Cecilia's warnings had touched
upon the rudimentary difficulties she found she had to
meet.  Before the furniture arrived, there was the first
cleaning of the little house to be done, and no one to
do it!  The summer people and their servants had
departed; the hotels were closed; the mountaineers held
themselves haughtily aloof from domestic service.
Eleanor would have known, but Mrs. Hetherbee kept
her from day to day; and Aunt Sue was taking her
own time in leaving Georgia.  Grace Tobet and
Yetta were always ready to do what they could, but
they were as untrained as Rosamund herself in the
methods of doing things as she had been used to
having them.  Yet they were the only ones she could find
to help her, and she spent her days in a toil so
unaccustomed as to leave her breaking with fatigue.  She
was ashamed to find how inadequate she was for such
elemental things; and disgust at her own limitations,
added to aching fatigue of body, left her little able to
stand against the opposition she was beginning to
encounter from everyone.
</p>

<p>
Pa Cary, gentlest of souls, became set in disapproval
as firmly as the doctor; and some undivulged,
disquieting information increased Ogilvie's first
distrust of the plan.  At last even Mother Cary
somewhat shamefacedly agreed with them.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know as it wouldn't be better to shut up
the house and stay right here with us, honey," she
said.  "Pap keeps tellin' me it ain't safe for ye there
alone, jest women and children.  I reckon that colored
man wouldn't skeer anybody off.  There's rough
people in the mountings.  They're used to folks
summerin' here; but Pap says, what with all this talk of
the Gov'ment's men bein' around, some are sayin'
you know too much about the doin's o' this part of the
country."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund knew the futility of expressing her
indignation.  She only felt that her die was cast,
arrangements irrevocably made, that she must go on.
Surely it was innocent enough to spend a winter in
the mountains, to keep a waif of a girl out of harm's
way, and give healing happiness to a child and a
beloved woman.  That her heart held other motive
only the secret flaming of her cheeks attested.  She
told herself that the mountain people could not be so
foolish as to disbelieve their own senses, and
determined to prove herself to them.  In time they must
come to believe in her honesty and sincerity of
purpose, in her friendship for them and her loyalty.  It
was largely their distrust of the world beyond their
close horizon that held them in bondage to their own
passions.  To enlighten them, to free them, would be
well worth while for anyone.  She said as much to
Ogilvie, who nevertheless continued to shake his head
and warn her.
</p>

<p>
With the departure of the last "foreigner" the
mountaineers were more frequently seen.  During the
summer Rosamund and Yetta had walked miles on
the strange, dimly marked paths through the woods,
paths as vague and deserted as if trodden only by
timid wild feet trembling towards secret drinking
places; never had they met another soul upon them.
But now, occasionally, they encountered lank women
or timid children, who peered with half-frightened
eyes out of the depths of slat bonnets, and sometimes
said "howdy" in passing.  The Allen children no
longer ran away at sight of her, and their mother,
now well enough to be about the house, watched
eagerly for Rosamund's visits; she had hopes of
making more friends among the women, through
Mrs. Allen and Grace Tobet.  Several times, too, Mother
Cary had visitors; and a little school in the valley
drew children from the hillsides in varying numbers.
As she went back and forth between the little brown
house and the Carys', the people she passed stared at
her curiously; the women, she thought, were not
unfriendly, but the men seemed distrustful and surly.
</p>

<p>
"Why do they look at me in that way?" she
asked Grace Tobet, on an afternoon when they were
hastening homeward in the twilight.  "The men all
look at me as if I were some hateful thing&mdash;a spy,
perhaps, or a&mdash;a snake!  It hurts me to have them
look at me in that way!  No one ever did before!  I
don't deserve it!"
</p>

<p>
But before Grace could reply a thing happened
that hurt Rosamund far more, that shook her to the
depths of her pride and courage.  Something struck
her upon the arm, something that stung and bruised&mdash;a
stone, thrown from the wood-side bushes with
accurate aim.  She cried out with physical pain and
pain that was also mental, and sprang towards Grace.
Someone moved off up the mountain, careless of the
crackling undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
Grace had her arms about Rosamund on the instant,
and her answering cry was almost as quick.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  What ails ye?" she besought the
trembling one within her sheltering arms.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's breath was coming in little sobbing
gasps.  "Oh&mdash;o&mdash;oh!  Something&mdash;struck me&mdash;a
stone, I think!"
</p>

<p>
From the wan spiritless creature that she usually
was, Grace flashed into a wild passion of anger.  Often
before she had reminded Rosamund of a sodden leaf,
wind-blown and colorless; now she was a flame, vivid,
devouring, like the hot blasts that mow down the
mountain forests.
</p>

<p>
"I'll KILL anyone that harms ye!" she cried;
and raising her voice to a shriek called to the woods
that hid the thrower of the stone:
</p>

<p>
"Come out!  Come out in the open!  Coward!
Ye coward!  Come out here and let yerself be seen!"
</p>

<p>
A jeering laugh answered, and Grace would have
sprung in pursuit; but Rosamund grasped her.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" she cried.  "Don't, Grace!  Don't!
Let him go!"
</p>

<p>
The mountain woman, panting, fiery, would have
broken away from the restraining hands; but
Rosamund, inspired, cried:
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't leave me here alone?"
</p>

<p>
And as a forest creature, quick to defend her
young, is quick to caress, Grace forebore vengeance
to hold her friend in a closer embrace.
</p>

<p>
"He struck ye!  You come up here to live with
us, and make friends with us, like Doctor Ogilvie,
and they go and say you spy out on them!  Oh&mdash;"
her voice echoed from the mountains&mdash;"I'll KILL
anyone that harms ye!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that!  Perhaps he did not mean
to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He meant it, whoever it was!  Stones don't fly
up from the ground, do they?  I know&mdash;I know what
they say, the lazy cowards&mdash;I know, I've heerd
'em&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused; a new terror came into her eyes.
"Miss Rose!  Miss Rose!  Don't ye go thinkin'
'twas Joe throwed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly her head dropped upon Rosamund's
shoulder, and the straining arms held her more closely.
"Miss Rose, even if 'twas Joe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Grace!  Oh, hush!  You don't know what you
are saying!  You must not think that&mdash;it couldn't be
true!"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't it?  You never saw my baby.  <i>He</i>
came home drunk, 'struck by lightnin''&mdash;that's what
they call it, so's not to lay blame on themselves.  He
fell on her.  That's how 'twas.  She was a-crawlin'
over the sill to meet him&mdash;her daddy.  An' he fell
on her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Put away those thoughts, Grace!  Put away
that memory!  Grace&mdash;look at me!  You must&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm lookin' at ye.  That's what makes me remember.
It ain't much to you, maybe, to be friends
with me.  But it's a heap to me, to be friends with
you.  Oh&mdash;" she threw her arms above her head, and
her bitter cry rang out.  "Oh, curse the stills!  Curse
'em, curse 'em!  First 'twas my baby, an' now&mdash;if
anyone harms you, even so be 'twas Joe, I'll kill
him!"
</p>

<p>
It was a devotion undreamed of.  Their friendship
had progressed insensibly.  There had been long
talks, when Grace's apparent simplicity had made it
easy for Rosamund to open her heart, as far as in
her lay; and she had been glad enough to feed the
other's hunger for knowledge with tales of the things
she had seen in the world, as Grace called all that lay
beyond the barrier of the mountains.  Yet it had been,
as Grace herself had rightly said, not a very large
part of life to Rosamund; all the stranger was the
revelation of what their friendship meant to Grace.
</p>

<p>
It was long before she could bind Grace to secrecy;
for Grace believed that safety lay in making
known the dastardly attack of the afternoon.  Rosamund
denied that actual danger could exist, that the
attacks&mdash;if such there might be&mdash;could possibly go
farther; and she very well knew that if to-day's were
made known it would put an end to all her plans for
the winter, now progressed so far.
</p>

<p>
Yet all that night she lay awake.  It was a dreadful
thing to know herself suspected, distrusted, perhaps
hated; why, she asked herself, could the mountaineers
not read her innocence in the very fact of her
remaining openly among them?  They did not suspect
Ogilvie; why, then, should they look upon her
innocent self as a spy?
</p>

<p>
But morning found her with all terrors gone.
Pride of race and knowledge of good intentions had
come to sustain her.
</p>

<p>
In gold, in gems, it is friction which produces
brilliancy; in the finer grades of humanity it is
opposition, anxiety, suffering, even misfortune, which
bring out inherent noble qualities that might else
remain undiscovered.  The fine courage of high race
Rosamund had always possessed, but it lay hidden
within her until the sting of an unseen enemy brought
it to light.  Fatigue and doubts and half-developed
fears fell from her in the night; with the coming of
the day she found herself strong in courage, in
resourcefulness.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie met her, later in the morning, coming
from the post office at the Summit, and White Rosy
stopped of her own accord until Rosamund had seated
herself in the buggy.
</p>

<p>
"You look less tired," he said.
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "I'm not tired at all!  I feel as if
I could move mountains, even these mountains; I
believe I could even move the people on them!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her more keenly, and wondered what
had caused her elation.  His anxiety for her&mdash;and
something else&mdash;was too great to permit of a smile
in answer to hers.
</p>

<p>
"It is never too late to mend your ways!" he
suggested.  "I hope it's a change of mind that's
making you so pleased with yourself!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed again, merrily.  "It may be a change
of mind," she said, "but it isn't a change of intention."
</p>

<p>
She waited for his question, but he only looked
grimly at White Rosy's joggling ears.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want to know what I mean?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said shortly.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund glanced at him.  "Dear me!" she remarked,
and was provokingly silent until, at last, he
turned towards her.
</p>

<p>
"Please!" he begged.
</p>

<p>
"Let's talk of something else," she said, and
turned her face away from him to hide her dimples.
"I don't in the least want to bore you with my
affairs.  You've been so kind!"
</p>

<p>
At that he shook his head, tumbled the old cap
into the back of the buggy, and ran his fingers
through his hair.  He heaved a deep breath, and said,
in the helpless tone of the bewildered male, "Oh,
Lord!"
</p>

<p>
Then she turned towards him and laughed aloud.
"I won't tease any more," she cried.  "You and
Father Cary almost frightened me, for a day or two,
with your warnings and forebodings.  Last night I
was ready to give up the brown house and telegraph
Mrs. Reeves not to come.  This morning I have
telegraphed her to hurry!"
</p>

<p>
His face became more stern.  "I don't like it.  I
don't approve of it.  You may take my word for it,
there will be trouble if you go to live in that place, an
unprotected household of women."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but we shall not be an unprotected household
of women!  We are going to have good old Uncle
Matt, my old nurse's husband!  Surely I told you?
Although," she thought to herself, "if old Matt saw
a man with a gun I believe he'd crawl under the bed!"
</p>

<p>
The doctor looked a little relieved.  "Well, that
is the best thing you've planned yet," he said.  "I
had intended coming twice a day and taking care of
your furnace myself; but Matt&mdash;did you say the
man's name was Matt?&mdash;will be on the spot."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" she exclaimed.  "I never once
thought of the furnace!"
</p>

<p>
"I imagined as much," he said, dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," she retorted, as he stopped before
the brown cottage, "you would never have remembered
to come!  White Rosy would have had just
one more thing on her mind!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
XIII
</h3>

<p>
The result of Rosamund's increased determination
was that, by the end of the week, a curiously
assorted household was taxing the capacity of the
cottage almost to the utmost.  Grace Tobet, however,
was not there.  Rosamund had many long talks with
her about other things; the poor soul had been
miserably uneasy since the episode of the stone-throwing,
and besought Rosamund to release her from her bond
of silence.  But that their friendship might bring
trouble upon herself she denied, and when Rosamund
tried to persuade her to take shelter in the brown
house she would do no more than shake her head or
raise the girl's hand to her own cheek in caress, or
look off to the hills with unseeing eyes tear-brimmed,
as on the first day she had spoken of her baby; and
Rosamund could not urge her farther after that.
</p>

<p>
"It's often that a way," Mother Cary said, when
Rosamund told her about it.  "It binds 'em to a
place faster than ropes could.  You can break through
most anything you can see, honey-bud; it's the things
you can't see that you can't get away from.  And
they holds you all the tighter when they're the things
you useter have and haven't any more&mdash;'specially
little child'en."
</p>

<p>
Eleanor, too, had a word to say on Grace's side.
"Can't you see, sweet, that if she leaves her Joe, she
will be admitting his unworthiness?"
</p>

<p>
"But since he plainly is unworthy&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"What he is has very little to do with it.  It is
what she must believe him to be, as long as she can."
</p>

<p>
"How can she believe him to be anything that is
good?  He killed their baby&mdash;and you know very
well that she has had to go through the woods all
alone at night to warn him when the Government men
are out."
</p>

<p>
Eleanor shook her head.  "We don't know that,
Rose.  And as long as Grace stays with him and says
nothing, we can't know it.  She is keeping that fact
from being knowledge&mdash;if it is fact.  Don't you see
that she just has to hold on to that vague 'if'?"
</p>

<p>
"But she cannot possibly love the man, Eleanor!"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor looked at her curiously, and for some
hidden reason which she could not define Rosamund's
heart, under that long look, began to beat faster.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Rosamund, which of us can understand
love?" Eleanor asked.  After a pause she added,
"I have wondered sometimes whether they really and
truly love&mdash;the people who question 'why'!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was beginning to be afraid of the turn
the conversation was taking.  "Oh, Eleanor!" she
exclaimed, somewhat impatiently, "your subtleties
are beyond me!"
</p>

<p>
While they talked, Tim had been tramping back
and forth on the front veranda of the house, himself
the horse of a little iron wagon that was one of
his new toys.  He was seldom willing that Eleanor
should waste time in uninteresting conversation with
grown-ups.  He had taken her for his own; and
Rosamund, Yetta, Mother Cary&mdash;everyone who had
ministered to him before&mdash;were all but forgotten.
Eleanor must now do everything for him; nothing
less than complete possession could satisfy his hungry
little heart.  And Eleanor's hunger for Tim went
beyond his for her; as she talked, her eyes followed
him, her look brooding upon him as if he were
new-born and her own.
</p>

<p>
At Rosamund's last exclamation she laughed, and
bending towards Timmy on one of his turnings,
gathered him into her arms, in spite of his indignantly
protesting squirms and thrusts.
</p>

<p>
"My subtleties, indeed!" she said, while burrowing
for kisses under the curls on his neck.  "I'm the
most elemental creature alive!  I'm nothing more
than a mother hen!"
</p>

<p>
"Matt chopped ve chicken's head off wif a ax,"
said Tim, "an' it hopped an' hopped an' hopped.
An' Sue took all its fevvers off.  But chickens don't
catch cold.  An' anyway its head was gone."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" said Rosamund.  "Matt ought not
to have let the child see that!  And I do wish he
wouldn't be so&mdash;so explicit!"
</p>

<p>
They laughed, but Eleanor could not ignore the
opportunity for a lesson in good manners.  She had
tried in vain to impress it upon Tim before; now she
repeated, "You must call her <i>Aunt</i> Sue, Timmy!  I
call her that, and Miss Rose does.  You want to be
polite, too, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
But Tim knew what he wanted; he had thought it
out for himself.  "She ain't," he said, frowning.
"An' I don't want her.  I got a muvver."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  The darling!" cried Eleanor, and let him
swagger back to his march with the wagon.
</p>

<p>
So the boy was provided for, and Eleanor daily
gained in health.  Ogilvie was delighted.
</p>

<p>
"Just let it go on for a few months," said he,
"and she'll forget she has any eyes.  Pity she'll have
to go back to work, though," he added.
</p>

<p>
He had been away for a few days, on some consultation,
and so could notice the change in her all the
more for his absence.  They were driving through the
golden woods; the first heavy frost had fallen the
night before.
</p>

<p>
Her breath fluttered a little as she answered.
"She will not have to work any more&mdash;not as she
used to&mdash;if she decides really to adopt Timmy," she
said, palpitating in wonder as to how he would take
the disclosure of her gift and what it implied.
</p>

<p>
He turned quickly to look at her, all interest.
"So that's what Flood meant!" he said.
</p>

<p>
She returned his look rather blankly.  "Mr. Flood?
What on earth do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I stayed with him in New York, you know.  He
told me the kiddie's future was provided for, but he
was too modest to tell me how.  That's one of the
things I like about him&mdash;his modesty.  He's a fine
fellow, Flood is."
</p>

<p>
It was something more than disconcerting to have
her generosity attributed to someone else; that he
should give the credit of it to Flood, of all people,
was plainly provoking.
</p>

<p>
"Did he give you to understand that he had done
the providing?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no!  I've just told you he was too
modest!"  Then, perhaps at something in her look
of disdain, he understood.  "Oh, I see!  I'm sure I
beg your pardon!  It is you who are doing it?"
</p>

<p>
She did not reply nor look at him, but flushed
deeply.
</p>

<p>
But he did not seem to think it mattered either
way.  "Well, it'll be the best thing in the world for
them both," he said.
</p>

<p>
So there was to be no word of praise for herself!
She forgot to wonder at his unquestioning acceptance
of the fact that she should have enough to spare for
such a gift; it did not occur to her until afterward
that he must have known of her fortune all along.
</p>

<p>
In her disappointment and dismay she spoke with
a little tremor of anger which did not escape him.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you think it is no more than I ought
to do!" she said.
</p>

<p>
He ran his fingers through his hair.  "Well!  Is
it?" he questioned.
</p>

<p>
She did not reply to that, and he asked, "You
will not miss what you give, will you?"  By his tone
he might have been asking, "Well, what of it?
What's money good for, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
At that she turned to him, head lifted, eyes
aflame.  "I suppose you are one of those people who
think that we ought to divide everything equally&mdash;number
the people and give them equal shares&mdash;so
many pennies apiece!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed good-humoredly.  "O Lord, no!  If
the wealth of the nations were equally divided on a
Monday, it would be back in the pockets it was taken
from by the first Saturday night!  The smart ones
would get it all back again."
</p>

<p>
"I am not one of the&mdash;'smart'&mdash;ones.  But I
suppose it wouldn't matter if I went hungry&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Whatever she had hoped for from that, his reply
was certainly unexpected.  He looked at her for a
moment, then put his head back and roared&mdash;laughed
until the woods rang, until White Rosy turned her
head to look at him, until Rosamund, her anger
melting, laughed with him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!" he cried at last.  "I'm awfully
sorry!  Miss Randall&mdash;you'll forgive me for being
so utterly stupid, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I did want you to praise me," she admitted,
dimpling.
</p>

<p>
Instantly he became serious.  "To praise you
would be like praising the sunlight, or the blessed
rain, or any other of the crowning works of God
Almighty," he said.
</p>

<p>
"We were talking of Timmy," she reminded him,
not quite truthfully, but grasping at anything that
might turn him from that strain, "and Mr. Flood!"
</p>

<p>
The ruse succeeded.  "Flood!  Yes.  He's a big man."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I quite realized that you were such
friends!"
</p>

<p>
"I like him," said Ogilvie.  "I like him mighty
well.  He's a chap who's not afraid to be fine.  I tell
you, it was a surprise to me to find him that
sort&mdash;Benson Flood.  You know, the name seems to
suggest bonanzas, show and glitter, crudeness, perhaps
a little&mdash;well&mdash;not what he is, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"But, surely, you have only seen him&mdash;twice,
three times, isn't it?  How can you possibly know all
that about him?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "Oh, men don't always have to
<i>learn</i> each other, as they would lessons, you know.  I
know what Flood is as well as if I had known him
for years&mdash;and I like him as well, too!"
</p>

<p>
She looked at his enthusiastic face a little
wonderingly.  "Women are not like that," she said.
"We&mdash;I don't think we&mdash;believe in our friends, as men
do!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come now!  Why don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because we don't.  And because we don't deserve
it.  Why, you talk about Mr. Flood, who is
certainly a new friend, to say the least, as if you would
make any sacrifice for him!  Women wouldn't do
that for each other."
</p>

<p>
He could not guess that her touch of bitterness
was due to her new humility&mdash;the humility she was
so rapidly learning through her experiences here in
the mountains; certainly he was far from seeing that
he had himself done much to teach it to her, even
during the past hour, when he had seemed to look upon
her wealth as of small significance; now he was
putting far more emphasis upon the fineness of character
of Flood, the man she had so lightly esteemed.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy Mrs. Reeves would have something to
say to that," said Ogilvie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Eleanor!  Eleanor is my exception, of
course!  We all have our exceptions.  But aside from
Eleanor, there is no one else for whom I would make
a sacrifice; yet you would do so for Mr. Flood,
wouldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
Now he was rumpling his hair until it stood on
end.  "Why, yes, I suppose so!  Yes, of course," he
said, as if he were wondering where the talk was
leading.  Then he put it aside, and turned towards her.
</p>

<p>
"How little you know yourself!" he said.
</p>

<h3>
XIV
</h3>

<p>
Before long there were ominous signs in the
Tobet cottage.  Mother Cary would shake her head
whenever Grace's name was mentioned.
</p>

<p>
"It's bad now, land knows!" she said.  "But
it'll be worse, come spring.  It ain't for me to deny
that them the Lord sends He looks out for; but a
body can't help wonderin' sometimes, at His choice
o' the places He sends 'em to.  Yet it's a livin'
wonder how things do work out, honey."
</p>

<p>
The doctor openly berated Joe, and the two would
have come to blows but for Grace's pleadings;
afterwards he told Rosamund that Mother Cary had
roundly scolded him for his interference, which of
course ended the little influence he had over the man.
Joe, indeed, swore that he would 'hurt' him if he
found him again in his house, and it was only at the
brown cottage or the Carys' that he could see poor
Grace and give her what help he could.  Tobet had
also, of course, forbidden his wife to hold
communication with 'the stranger woman'; but Grace knew
his ways and times well enough to go occasionally to
both her friends' houses.  She herself could not have
told from which she derived more comfort.
</p>

<p>
For a while Rosamund was unaware of any further
evidences of the mountaineers' distrust; then, in
the third week, came the most disquieting thing that
had yet happened.
</p>

<p>
Their evenings at the cottage were usually placid
enough.  Rosamund had engaged the services of the
young teacher of the district school to give lessons to
Yetta, who, with the mental avidity of her race, was
fairly absorbing knowledge, and rapidly acquiring
the speech and manner of the world.  She worshiped
Rosamund, and tried to copy her in everything; she
was urged onward, too, by her awakened ambition
to sing, it being understood that her general
education must be well on the way before the promised
singing lessons should begin.  The girl would have
spent hours at her books, but Ogilvie had forbidden
her reading at night; and Rosamund would read
aloud to her for an hour or two after the lamps were
lighted.
</p>

<p>
To-night Yetta had begged, as usual, for a later
bed hour, and for once had been indulged.  The wind
had blown from the east all day, bleak and cold.
Rosamund had been more and more restless with each
passing hour, and now had a longing for company
which made her lenient with Yetta.  But at last the
girl had reluctantly gone upstairs; and after a while
Rosamund went up, too, in search of Eleanor.
</p>

<p>
She had not been the only one in the house to be
made restless by the wind; Tim had been cross all
day, and even Eleanor was glad at last to see him
safely tucked into bed.  But, having done so, she had
scarcely taken her place on the opposite side of the
table from Rosamund and Yetta, than a little white-clad
figure appeared in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"O Timmy!" Eleanor had cried, protesting.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I forgot to God-bless Pa Cary," said Tim,
as if that justified his reappearance.
</p>

<p>
"Tim!  Go right back to bed!" said Eleanor,
with a conscientious attempt at sternness.  Tim
hesitated, wavered on the threshold, and she gained in
courage.  "Go back at once!" she said.
</p>

<p>
His under lip began to tremble.  "I can't God-bless
wivout somebody to say it to!" he said, and
Eleanor got up, took him by the hand, and led him up
to bed and his devotions.
</p>

<p>
Since then she had not come down again, and
when Rosamund went in search of her it was to find
her on her knees beside Tim's bed, asleep, her pale
gold hair mingling with the yellow of his, her arms
across his little body, one of his hands on her cheek.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund crept downstairs again, the loneliness
of a moment ago pressing now upon her heart like a
pain.  The sitting-room was warm and cosy, with its
open fire and the lamp with a yellow shade; but it was
empty, for all that.  She crossed the room to the
window that faced the valley and rolled up the shade.
Through the wind-swept air Mother Cary's light
twinkled brightly on the opposite mountain; that was
a home, too.  It added to her sense of loneliness.  She
went back to her place by the table, her thoughts
wandering&mdash;from the happy two in the room overhead,
to her plans for Yetta; from Ogilvie, to Flood; from
the present&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But, gradually, insensibly, into her mental atmosphere,
there crept a shadowy, indefinable influence,
something malevolent and strangely disquieting.  She
had never known fear; but as she sat there she shuddered,
became cold with an unearthly chill, as if some
premonition of horror were laying its clammy hand
upon her.  She said afterward that she felt herself
in a cloud of dread and apprehension such as one
might feel before the apparition of something ghostly
or uncanny.  It was intolerable.  She must shake off
such mental cowering, and forced herself to turn
towards the window through which Mother Cary's
light could be seen, thinking the friendly beacon
would reassure her.
</p>

<p>
Then, although her heart seemed for an instant
to stop beating, she sprang up; but her knees refused
their burden, and she sank again into her chair,
leaning forward with straining eyes, clutching its arms;
for the light on the mountain was blotted out by a
hideous thing, a white face set in shaggy hair, a
sneering face, a face where drink and hate and fear had
set their marks.  As she sprang up and sank down
again the wicked glare of hate turned into a more
frightful leer; then the creature raised a horrid fist,
shook it towards her&mdash;and vanished into the night.
</p>

<p>
It was Eleanor who came running downstairs at
the cry she tried to choke back.
</p>

<p>
The two kept watch through the night, and morning
found Rosamund shaken and feverish, but firmly
determined to lay aside her dread, and at all hazards
to keep her friends in the city in ignorance of it.
</p>

<p>
She shuddered at the thought of what the newspapers
would make of it, and of Cecilia's raging, and
Pendleton's taunting comments.  She and Eleanor,
in the reassuring daylight, tried to laugh away each
other's fears; and both agreed that they would not
be frightened away from the brown house; they
agreed, too, that Ogilvie must not know.
</p>

<p>
But to keep the doctor in ignorance of what had
happened was not so easy as Rosamund had hoped.
He had many opportunities of hearing rumors that
did not reach her; if he had not constantly persisted in
his warnings it was not because he no longer feared
for her, but because it seemed best to watch, rather
than to warn.  He went to the cottage every day on
one pretext or another; if it was not fear alone which
took him there, he admitted to himself no other reason.
</p>

<p>
It was not altogether because he was too busy
with his mountaineer patients, as Mother Cary had
told Rosamund, that he had remained among them;
now and again he had consulted his friends, and his
vigorous enjoyment of the days as they passed also
told unmistakably of his recovery; but another year
of mountain practice would doubly insure his safety
in going back to his investigations in the confinement
of the laboratory.  Meanwhile he had thrown himself
into the work here with ardor, as he must always
do with work or play; but now just at the time when
he was beginning to think of his return to the city
there came into his thoughts an influence as disturbing
as it was novel.
</p>

<p>
Early in the summer one of his classmates, the
Doctor Blake who was Mother Cary's old friend,
had come from the city for a visit of a day or two,
and to him Rosamund's name was unmistakably well
known.  He had seen her, too, in town.  There could
be no mistake; she was the only daughter of old
Randall, the "king" of Georgia pine.  It seemed to
Blake a wild freak which kept such a girl here in the
mountains, away from her kind, a freak to be
distrusted.  He watched Ogilvie rather keenly when
they met Rosamund at Mother Cary's that afternoon,
but it was evident that Ogilvie was master of
whatever emotions he might have towards her.  As a
matter of fact, her money counted no more in his
estimate of her than a scar on her cheek, or a strand of
gray hair, or an ignorance of German would have
counted.  He knew himself for a man, and more; he
knew, as they who possess the embryo of greatness
never fail to know, that he had that to offer which all
her money could not buy; the belief that she, too,
knew as much was fast becoming the essence of life
for him.
</p>

<p>
The thought of her filled his days and half his
nights.  Her swinging step along the frozen roads,
the tired child nestling in her arms, the cadence of her
voice as she greeted him, the look of shy withdrawal
that he sometimes surprised in her eyes&mdash;all would
set him inwardly trembling, longing, worshiping.
Yet love was new to him, and he feared; inexperience
had left him with nothing for comparison.  He
could not know how far to venture.  Masculine
instinct warned him to display to her the brightest
plumage of his mind and heart, and their walks and
drives together were full of talk and intimate silences;
but of that which was uppermost in his desire he
feared to speak.
</p>

<p>
Yet his fears no less than his love made him keen
to notice every shade of expression on her face, and
on the morning after her fright at the hideous vision
at the window he saw at once that something was
amiss.  He had been over the mountain earlier in the
day to set a man's broken arm, and several things had
made him more than usually suspicious that the
underworld of the woods was stirring uneasily.  A storm
of some sort was certainly in the air; the people
showed themselves distrustful even of him, and the
very children shrank into reserve at his approach.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund had walked across the valley to
Mother Cary's, to confide to her the strange disturbing
happening of the night; then she had gone home
again, hoping for that day to escape Ogilvie's keen
eyes.  The tale had been most disquieting to the old
woman, and when Rosamund had gone, she sent Pap
to the main road to hail the doctor as he passed.  She
had been bound to secrecy, but she could at least,
without breach of trust, send him a message.
</p>

<p>
"You tell Doctor Ogilvie that I say when wolves
are out, lambs 're in danger.  Jest that; don't say
another word.  Ef he's all I take him for he'll
understand."
</p>

<p>
Pap repeated the message word for word and the
two men looked into each other's eyes for a moment,
in a look that told far more than the message; then
Ogilvie whipped up White Rosy with unprecedented
emphasis, and the old mare gallantly responded, as
if she knew that an emergency prompted the
unaccustomed touch.  Ogilvie was sure that one glance at
Rosamund's face would tell him whether she were the
lamb Mother Cary had in mind; and the girl's pale
cheeks, that flushed so treacherously when he entered
the brown cottage, disclosed the secret she would have
kept.  But Mother Cary must not be betrayed, and
he greeted her as if he suspected nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I saw Aunt Sue at the clothesline," he said, "so
I used the doctor's privilege and just walked in!
Tell me if I'm in the way."
</p>

<p>
She turned a large chair towards the blaze in the
fireplace and moved her own a little back, as if to
credit her bright color to the heat of the flames.
</p>

<p>
"Doctors are always welcome," she said.
</p>

<p>
But that did not satisfy him, and with characteristic
directness he pursued the question.  "Am I not
welcome as a friend, too?"
</p>

<p>
She bent forward to reach the tongs, and lifted a
glowing ember.  "You're welcome in every rôle!
But you are very formal to-day, aren't you, in spite
of your just walking in?  Why?"
</p>

<p>
She was always mistress of herself when she could
tease.  Ogilvie, however, would not respond to her
levity.
</p>

<p>
"Because doctors may prescribe, and friends may
advise; as it happens, I want to do both!"
</p>

<p>
She sat up very straight and looked at him
mockingly.  "Dear me!" she said, in the dry tone which
usually provoked all his Scotch combativeness.
</p>

<p>
But to-day that, also, he ignored.
</p>

<p>
"Where are Mrs. Reeves and the children?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Eleanor has taken Tim on a hunt for nuts, and
Yetta is at her lessons."
</p>

<p>
He frowned.  "Which way have they gone?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not the least idea."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Grace lately?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not," she replied.  "Pray don't mind
asking about anything you want to know!"
</p>

<p>
He would not notice her flippancy even to frown.
"Because," he said, "she is not at her own house,
nor the Allens', and she has not been to the Carys'
since yesterday morning; if she has not been here
either, there is only one thing possible&mdash;or at all
likely&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At last Rosamund became serious; if Grace had
gone into the woods it could, indeed, mean but one
thing.  "Oh, dear!" she cried.  "Does that
mean&mdash;do you think?&mdash;that Joe is out again?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor nodded.  "And has been for several
days.  The trouble is coming to a head somewhere.
I wish I knew where.  The very air is full of it, and
these people are so mysterious that even I cannot get
anything definite.  Pa Cary says they all believe there
are spies about."
</p>

<p>
At the word, Rosamund's hand went to her throat,
and her lips paled.  "Oh, then&mdash;&mdash;" she began, and
stopped.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie leaned forward and laid his hand on the
arm of her chair.
</p>

<p>
"Then?" he repeated, looking closely at her.
</p>

<p>
His intentness forced the tale from her.  He
listened without interrupting, and when she had
finished, sat for a while in deep meditation.
</p>

<p>
At last he drew a long breath, rose, took a turn
or two about the little room, and came and stood
before her, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"You shall not stay here," he said.
</p>

<p>
Of all words he could have chosen none more
unfortunate.  A tone of fear, a phrase of hidden
tenderness, even an appeal to her own sense of the
futility of braving the hovering danger&mdash;almost anything
but the words and tone he used would have induced
her to submit to his wishes; but this imperative
command of words and voice touched off some quick,
foolish spark within her.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but that is precisely what I am going to
do," she calmly declared.  "They will find out sooner
or later that I am not a spy.  I shall remain here
until they do."
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously, as once before, her name escaped
him.  "Rosamund," he cried, "I cannot stand it!  I
cannot bear to think of your being in danger!"
</p>

<p>
If she heard, she gave no sign of it.  "I do not
believe there is the slightest danger," she said, "but
what if there is?  I have taken up my life here; there
are always difficulties to be overcome whenever one
wants really to do anything.  Why should I run
away from my share of them?"
</p>

<p>
He had turned toward the fire, his arm resting
upon the mantel-shelf, and his forehead upon his
clenched hand.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could make you understand how it is
with me," she went on.  "I have chosen, deliberately
chosen, to take this way of living.  I have come here
to stay, for a time anyway.  You would tell me, I
know, that I could have the same little family
somewhere else.  I know I could; but I am not staying
only on their account, any more than I am for a mere
whim of my own.  The place is more my home than
any I have ever known since I was a little girl.  I
love it, and I see so many things to be done, things
I can do; and I want to do them.  I don't always
know how, but I am learning.  These mountain
people are distrustful of everyone; but all wild creatures
can be tamed, if one has patience.  When they have
learned to trust me I can help them.  I am not going
to be driven away.  Besides, when all else is said,
I don't see the need of it!"
</p>

<p>
"You had warning last night.  Whoever that
ruffian was, his coming here meant no good to you."
</p>

<p>
For a while she was silent, and when she spoke he
looked at her, and saw that there were tears in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I cannot argue it out," she cried.  "Of
course, you can array fact upon fact to prove me
wrong and foolish.  Oh&mdash;Doctor Ogilvie, be fair!
Credit me with a purpose!  I have never before had
a chance to go on in a simple, clearly defined line of
action.  It would not seem very much to most people,
I suppose&mdash;merely to stay here, to live in this
little cottage with Eleanor and the children.  But it's
the only real life I've ever known, as far as I can
remember.  I was dropped into this place by accident,
and I found something to do.  What is more, I found
myself among real people.  It is not much&mdash;but to
live my own life&mdash;that is what I want!"  In her
emotion she stood before him, straight and purposeful.
"Won't you give me credit for the strength of
it, and not believe me merely willful?"
</p>

<p>
He was deeply moved; she laid her own in the
hand he held out to her.  "I will credit you with
everything that is brave and good," he said, with
utmost seriousness.  "If you are really determined
to remain here, I will not interfere.  If this is what
you choose, I will try to believe it is the best thing
for you&mdash;the only thing."
</p>

<p>
Her earnestness had fanned in his heart an altar-flame
of worship and new faith; its glow shone in
his eyes, and her face paled under his look.  In the
tenseness of the moment there could be no speech, but
it seemed as if their souls sped toward each other on
a bridge of understanding.  They were hushed before
the vision of great elemental truth; and although
later they came to believe that they had been deluded,
that vision of truth remained as having passed
between them, a revelation and a message.
</p>

<p>
Afterward, in the hours when doubt and pain
and loneliness were her companions, she often
wondered what the outcome might have been; but she
could only wonder, for at the highest moment of their
silent communion there sounded a well-remembered
view-halloo, and a quick turn of the head showed the
flash of a big red car that was stopping before the
house.
</p>

<p>
With a low cry she drew away the hand that had
been held in his, turned from him, and for an instant
hid her face in her two palms, needing the moment to
recall her soul from the heights.  When she turned
at the sound of steps upon the veranda Ogilvie was
gone; she stooped to pick up his worn brown cap, left
unheeded upon the hearth, put it quickly into a
drawer, and turned the key in the lock.

<p>
The revulsion of feeling was so sharp as to demand
all the effort she was capable of making to
move at all.  Her self-control had never before been
so severely tested; the strain was so great that she
forgot to smile, until Pendleton, drawing off his
gloves and toasting his back at the fire, which he first
took pains to rearrange with as serene assurance as if
it had been his own house, said:
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, Rosamund!  Why this exuberant
gayety of welcome?"
</p>

<p>
It was easy enough to laugh, and she felt secretly
grateful for his nonsense.  She had almost forgotten
the time when she had found such banter on her own
part a veritable shield and buckler.
</p>

<p>
"I'm stunned with joy, Marshall," she laughed.
Then, turning to Flood, "Have my woods brought you?"
</p>

<p>
He flushed with joy that she should have remembered
their talk on the Pocantico ride.  "Your woods
and what's in them," he told her.  "I've brought
down a couple of young dogs, and we thought we'd
try for some shooting before the snow.  That's due
any day now, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the season has been unusually late, they
say.  But, Mr. Flood, you must not try to do any
shooting around here!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" Pendleton put in, raising his eyebrows;
he succeeded in trying to look teasing only so
far as to appear malicious.  "Tame birds, Rose?"
</p>

<p>
She ignored his impudence.  "You'd get me into
greater disfavor than ever," she said, speaking to
Flood.  "You know there are said to be illicit stills
in these mountains; there have been some lawless
things done within a year or two, and the Government
is watching the people here, or so they believe.
They are distrustful of everybody&mdash;my poor
innocent self included."
</p>

<p>
"I hope there's nothing unpleasant?" Flood
asked, looking disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"No!  Oh, dear, no!  But there might be, if
you went about in the woods with your guns, and
were known to be my friends."
</p>

<p>
"Your fears are quite groundless, my dear," said
Pendleton.  "We were not going to stop here, anyway,
but Flood hesitates to disillusion you.  There's
no hotel in your neighborhood, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad!" she cried, and then joined the
two men in their laugh.  "Oh, Marshall, you're
always making me absurd!  You know perfectly well
what I mean!  I had horrible visions of your being
murdered in the woods; naturally, I'm not glad
there's no place for you to stay!  I wish I could put
you up here, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly!" said Flood, to her expressive
pause.  "We understand how impossible it would be.
Fact is, we thought we'd run down to Oakleigh for a
few days, and we found we wanted to come a bit out
of the path and call on you!  Hope you don't mind?"
</p>

<p>
To her surprise she realized that she was really
very glad to see them.  She had within the hour been
declaring that she had put away the old life, yet here
were these two dropped from the skies of chance, to
remind her of it; and she was undeniably glad to see
them!
</p>

<p>
It ended in their staying to the midday dinner,
when Aunt Sue surpassed the standard of her own
fried chicken and beaten biscuits, and Matt could be
heard turning the ice-cream freezer all during the first
part of the meal, and Tim had to be suppressed by
Eleanor because he would persist in trying to describe
how the chickens they were eating had hopped and
hopped and hopped when Matt had chopped their
heads off.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time Flood had met Eleanor, and
it was immediately evident that she impressed him
very much.  His look was upon her more than upon
Rosamund; he watched her every move with a light
of pleasure in his eyes, and his manner toward her
was exquisite&mdash;holding something of the deference
of a young man toward a very charming, very old
lady, something of the tenderness of a physician
toward a courageous patient, something of a courtier's
manner toward a queen, a little of the look of
the lover of beauty at something unexpectedly lovely.
And since Eleanor was neither old nor ill nor yet a
queen, it must have been her loveliness, fragile and
gentle and rare, that had attracted him, since attracted
he so plainly was.
</p>

<p>
He would look from Eleanor to Rosamund from
time to time as if trying to convey, silently, to the
woman whom he held above all others how lovely he
found her friend; and Rosamund, understanding and
liking him for it, drew Eleanor out of the little
tiredness of manner that was apt to fall upon her before
strangers, and Flood brought the color to Eleanor's
cheeks when he noticed how Timmy had blossomed
under her care.  Indeed, the little boy, with the quick
adaptability of babyhood, might have been petted and
adored all his life, so complacently did he accept his
new mother's care and ignore the comments of Flood;
for the moment he was absorbed in the celery family
which he had spread out before him on the tablecloth.
</p>

<p>
"It's me an' my muvver," he said to himself, as
he arrayed a short stalk and some longer ones before
him, "an' it's Miss Rose, an' it's Yetta, an' it's Matt.
An' vey ain't any Sue!"  Tim could not be prevailed
upon to accept Aunt Susan, apparently feeling that in
order to repudiate the relationship which he thought
her title of courtesy implied he must repudiate her
entirely.
</p>

<p>
After dinner Rosamund managed so that a rather
reluctant Flood and Eleanor should be led off by Tim
to inspect the chickens.  Pendleton was by no means
disdaining to pay homage to Yetta's black eyes, and
for a while Rosamund watched the two with amusement.
</p>

<p>
It was the first opportunity Rosamund had found
for measuring the girl's improvement.  It was
amusing to see how well Yetta had learned to imitate
Eleanor's manners and her own, how seldom she
lapsed into the speech of the streets, yet how much of
her native quickness and assurance she had retained.
She was never at a loss for an answer to Pendleton's
banter; and Pendleton, soaring to farther and farther
heights of absurdity, was enjoying himself immensely,
when Rosamund decided that Yetta had had enough,
and sent the girl off to her lessons.
</p>

<p>
"Now what did you break it up for, Rose?"
Pendleton protested, adding, "It's wonderful how
jealous all you women are of me!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "Marshall!  Your absurdity is
only exceeded by your modesty!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know my worth," said he, folding his
hands and looking down, with his head on one side.
Apparently he never tired of playing the clown.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about Cecilia," said Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, dear Cecilia!  She's looking very well this
autumn, very well indeed.  And young!  And slim!
I admire dear Cecilia's slimness exceedingly.  It's a
monument to perseverance and self-denial."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund understood, and smiled with him.
"Her letters have sounded very happy, so I've taken
it for granted that things have gone well with her,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're responsible for that, aren't you?
'Pon my word, if Cecilia had money enough&mdash;or I
had&mdash;to make her contented&mdash;&mdash;"  He sighed.  "But
Cecilia's up to something.  She doesn't seem to&mdash;er&mdash;to
care as much for my company as she did.  Why,
Rose, would you believe it, she even sent down word
to me the other day that she had a headache!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she had," Rosamund suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  No.  If she had, she would have let
me see her.  I'm good for headaches.  No, it wasn't
that.  Besides, it was the very day after Flood told
her he was coming here, and asked if she had any
messages for you.  No.  Cecilia's up to something."
</p>

<p>
He wilted sideways in his chair, and tried to look
pensive and pathetic.  Rosamund watched him,
amused as always, and not in the least understanding
what he was trying to imply.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he leaned toward her.  "And you're
up to something, too, Rosy!" he said, as if throwing
the words at her.  "What's your game in staying
down here, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
She flushed angrily.  "Marshall!  You go too
far, you know!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come along, don't get mad!" he said.
"What's your little game?  Are you staying up here
to draw old Flood on, or is it something else?  I
won't tell!"
</p>

<p>
She felt herself enveloped in a hot wave of anger
and disgust, as if the fetid breath of some foul
creature had blown toward her.  She sprang from her
chair and went swiftly toward the long window, and
throwing it open stepped down to the piazza.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton followed as calmly as if nothing had
been said to arouse her; but she was spared an
answer, even a look, for Eleanor and Flood were
coming back to the house, Flood declaring that it was
time for their adieux.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was glad; she had been unexpectedly
glad to see them, but now her pleasure was gone.  She
felt sick at heart, and wanted to be alone.  Yet her
pride sustained her until they were gone; she stood
on the veranda to wave farewell to them as if
nothing had happened, one arm about Yetta's shoulders,
framed against the background of the little brown
house that Flood thought so inadequate a shelter for
a creature so beloved and so rare.
</p>

<p>
Flood felt that he had been discretion itself.  He
had learned his lesson, and was now too anxious for
ultimate success to risk alarming her; but every move
she made, every look, every tone had been as meat
and drink to his longing.
</p>

<p>
On their way back past the Summit his mind and
heart were full of her, from her first silent greeting to
the last glimpse of her with her arm across the child's
shoulders.  How like her unerring taste, he thought,
to have chosen as friend so exquisite a creature as
that Mrs. Reeves; and how right Mrs. Reeves had
been in all her praise of Rosamund!  It had seemed
to him to-day that her face had been more than ever
full of dancing play of color; certainly her cheeks
had flamed when she had come out of that long
window to meet him.
</p>

<p>
But Pendleton broke in on his dreams.  "Our
Rosy was looking exceedingly blooming," said he.
"Wonder what's up?"
</p>

<p>
He managed to throw something of insinuation
into his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shut up, you ass!" said Flood.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Mr. Pendleton raised his eyebrows,
smiled, and proceeded to whistle the "Merry Widow
Waltz," which he knew Flood detested, for one
immortal hour.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Later in the evening, when Tim and Yetta had
been long in bed, Rosamund and Eleanor were in
the sitting-room before the fire, the table with its
yellow-shaded lamp drawn up between them.  Since
the night of Rosamund's fright the shades were kept
drawn at night; now the room, in its seclusion, was
warm and cosy with the sense of home.  Eleanor
smiled over a garment of Timmy's that she was mending;
she stopped, from time to time, to look into the
fire, laying the work in her lap as if it were a task
over which she loved to linger.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund sat back in her big chair, her eyes
partly closed, deep in thought.  The day had been
full of crowding emotions.  She mentally recalled
first one and then another, trying to marshal them
into some sequence of cause and event.
</p>

<p>
On the last moments between herself and John
Ogilvie she dwelt least; even in memory they were
too palpitating.  It is only after surrender, or after
loss, that a woman loves to dwell upon such moments;
before, they hold too much of fear, not to call forth
the feminine withdrawal of the unwon.  His looks
she dared recall; his pale intensity, the flame in his
eyes, the fear and anger there as she described the
wicked face at the window, his look before he left
her, when Pendleton's step was already on the
veranda.
</p>

<p>
That brought her thoughts to Pendleton, to his
insinuations and the slight leer in his look.  She
shuddered all the more because she knew that, a few
months before, she would have parried his impertinence
with a laugh, instead of with the scorn and anger
she had not been able to hide to-day.  She was at
least that far from the old life, the old state of mind!
She knew now how intolerable she would find the
people who had seemed only commonplace before!
Looking back, secure in her new life in this purer air,
she could say to herself how much she hated their
suspicions of everyone, their petty gossip, their
searching for hidden, unworthy motives in every least
action, their expecting the base to emerge from every
innocence, their smiling, flattering faces.
</p>

<p>
She was glad, she told herself, so glad to be away
from all that&mdash;all the more glad because she could
remember the time when it had not especially
displeased her.  Yet in fairness she reminded herself
that Flood was different.  He had been very nice,
indeed, to-day&mdash;and he had liked Eleanor.  It spoke
well for him that Eleanor, too, liked him!  She
looked across at Eleanor's tenderly brooding face, and
smiled; how suitable it would be, she thought, if
Flood and Eleanor&mdash;that would relieve herself of
Flood's intentions.  It was the first time she had been
willing to admit that she knew what they were&mdash;and
intentions on Flood's part would be quite delightful
if Eleanor were their object&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
So her thoughts passed, from one thing to another,
until, suddenly, as if a shot had broken her
dream, her heart stood still with fear, then seemed to
leap into her throat.
</p>

<p>
She and Eleanor were on their feet in an instant,
hands grasping hands, startled eyes searching each
other's and then turning toward the door.  This
time it was no stealthy presence which had crept upon
the house to peer in at the window.  Even while they
held each other, there in their safety before the fire,
something stumbled across the piazza, fell against
the door, cried out, seemed to fall farther, as if at
the limit of strength&mdash;and was still.
</p>

<p>
Even the negroes in the kitchen heard the noise,
and came running in with scared faces.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund moved quickly and quietly to the door,
silently slid back the bolt, and flung it open.
</p>

<p>
There was no lurking enemy to surprise.  Instead,
a huddled form lay, as if crushed, before the
doorsill.  Between them they managed to lift it and
bear it upstairs.  All the way up Eleanor, though
trembling and very white, carried her full share of
the burden, and kept saying over and over to Rosamund:
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, sweet!  Don't be frightened!  It's
all right, sweet!  Don't be frightened!"
</p>

<p>
And Rosamund was saying over and over, on
sobbing breath, "O Grace!  Poor Grace!  O Grace!"
</p>

<p>
They laid her on a bed and undressed her.  The
poor cut feet were soiled with blood and seemed
frozen; the forehead beneath the pale strands of
hair&mdash;those pathetic strands of the woman in whom pride
and vanity are dead&mdash;was cut and bruised; on her
body they found larger bruises.  They bathed her,
and wrapped her in clean linen, and made her as
comfortable as they could.  Aunt Sue and Eleanor
exchanged looks, and shook their heads.  They sent
Matt after the doctor.  Then Timmy called out, and
Eleanor went to him.  Aunt Sue said something
about more hot water, and descended to the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund knelt beside the bed, and presently
Grace fluttered back to a dim consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Rose!  Miss Rose!" were her first words,
uttered in a tone of fright.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear!  I am here," said Rosamund, laying
one of her cool hands on Grace's forehead.
</p>

<p>
Grace closed her eyes as if satisfied.  "I had to
come," she whispered.  "It wasn't only for me."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
XVI
</h3>

<p>
The doctor promptly, in his most professional
manner, turned Rosamund out of the room as
soon as he got there.  He preferred the old colored
woman even to Eleanor as assistant; and he showed no
sign of remembering that night in the Allen house
when Rosamund had fought beside him, through the
heavy hours, for a woman's life.  When he closed the
door of Grace's room upon her, she was keenly hurt;
she could not know that while he worked over poor
Grace he was recalling every moment of that earlier
scene, viewing it now through the glamor of his later
knowledge of her.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Sue was installed as supreme power in the
sick-room.  Grace's life hung by a thread for days,
and before the doctor could be sure that all would be
well the disquieting news of Joe Tobet's arrest came
to disturb them still further.
</p>

<p>
Snow lay deep over everything before Grace came
down among them, a pale wraith of a woman, but
with a deepened sweetness of expectation in her face.
They feared to tell her of Joe's predicament, but
knew afterward that it would have been better to do
so; for she was to discover it in one of those
unforeseen, brutal ways that so often accompany the
disasters of the poor.  One day a shivering small boy
brought a note to the back door, and Grace herself
happened to be the one to take it in.  It would have
been less cruel to give her a coal of living fire.
</p>

<p>
The folded paper was soiled, as if it had been
passed from hand to hand.  Its pencilled words were:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"You or she told Youl be got even with Curs
you JOE."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Grace waited to speak of it until the doctor came.
Then her dignity of manner was a revelation to Rosamund,
who had yet to discover that elemental passions
can sometimes be as silent as the ages that create
them.
</p>

<p>
Grace looked unfalteringly at Ogilvie as she
spoke.  "Where have they got Joe?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund exclaimed, and motioned to him not to
reply; but he was wiser than she.  His answer, as
simple and direct as her question, gave no evidence
of surprise.  "In the city.  The jail is stronger there."
</p>

<p>
"Will they let him out?"
</p>

<p>
"The evidence may not be enough to hold him.
He is awaiting trial."
</p>

<p>
"Will we know if they let him out?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so."
</p>

<p>
Then she gave him the soiled paper, which he
read and passed on to Rosamund.  "He wrote that,"
she said.  "Miss Rose hadn't ought to be here when
he gets out."
</p>

<p>
She gave Rosamund a look of agonized tenderness,
then left them.  Presently they heard her walking
in her room upstairs, up and down, up and down.
Ogilvie shook his head when Rosamund asked him
to go up to her.
</p>

<p>
"She must work it out alone," he said.  "She's
strong enough."
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund, uneasy, went to Mother Cary.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she's strong enough," the old woman said,
when she had heard all about it.  "Land!  She's got
to be!  An' she's jest got to fight it out by herself.
Don't you try to cross her, honey, nor say anything
to ease her, 'cause that ain't the way to treat hurts
like that.  Joe's her man, an' she'd lay down her life
for him, ef 'twas only her own life; an' I reckon even
ef she thought 'twould save his soul she couldn't 'a'
found stren'th to tell on him.  Yet that's what he
thinks she done!  Eh, me!  The contrairy fools men
like him can be when they sets out!"
</p>

<p>
"He's not worth her caring for!  He's not worth it!"
</p>

<p>
"Land, no!  I shouldn't think he was!  But that
ain't got a mite to do with it!  Women folks don't
care for them they ought to care for, jest because
they ought to; nor they don't stop carin' when they
ought to stop, neither.  An' Joe bein' her man, she
can't give a thought to whether he's worth it or not;
she's jest got to go on lovin' him."
</p>

<p>
"But, oh!" the girl cried, "shouldn't you think
his distrust would make her loathe him?  To know
herself a true and faithful wife, and to be distrusted!
Oh!"
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary's eyes were very bright as she looked
out of the window across the snowy field to where
Pap was cutting down a tree for firewood.  She took
one of Rosamund's hands in hers before she spoke,
and patted it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I reckon distrust must be about one of the
hardest things to set down under," she said.  "I know
somethin' about it, 'cause time was when I distrusted
Pap, though 'twas before we was married, o' course.
I distrusted Pap's love, like poor Joe distrusts Grace's.
I thought he couldn't possibly love me enough to last
for ever an' always, me bein' crippled up like I be;
an' I thought it wasn't fair to let him try.  So I up
an' run away.  I tried to get to the station an' so
back to the city.  It was a long ol' walk for me, an'
I had to hide all one night in a barn.  But betwixt
walkin' an' hobblin' an' crawlin' I got to the station
at last; an' there was Pap a-waitin' to take me into
his arms, which he did then an' there, good an' strong.
I ain't never tried to get far from 'em sence!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was afraid to break the thread of the
story by a question, and the old woman mused a while
before she went on.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon there's a door o' distrust that most of
us have to open and pass through an' shet fast behind
us, before we get to the place where's only content,
an' love, an' trust.  It ain't confined to jest a few;
'pears to me most everybody has to go through it."
</p>

<p>
Again she paused, while the girl waited.
</p>

<p>
"When your time comes, honey&mdash;an' I hope it
will come, 'cause you can't rightly feel the glory tell
you know the shadder&mdash;when your time comes to feel
distrust, or have it felt against you, jest you do as
your Ma Cary tells you!  You take a firm holt o'
your heart and your thoughts, an' don't you let 'em
turn all topsy-turvy!  You jest take a firm holt on
'em an' wait.  WAIT!  Don't run away, like I did;
'cause they ain't any more Pap Carys in the world!
It ain't everybody you'd find ahead of you at the
station, waitin'.  You jest remember that it ain't but
a door, even though the doorsill does seem dretful
wide.  It'll shet behind you, when the right time
comes, an' you'll find yo'self a-standin' in the land o'
content.  That's the best dwellin'-place there is, I'm
a-tellin' you!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund had not been alone with John Ogilvie
since the afternoon, three weeks earlier, when Flood's
automobile interrupted them; but during the interval
she was conscious of an uplift of the soul, a new
serenity.
</p>

<p>
One of the great memories of her life was of an
hour of her childhood when for the first time a
revelation of something beyond her childish world was
vouchsafed to her.  She had been awakened at night
by a touch of light upon her face; the full moon shone
through her window, and its rays had called her from
sleep.  In her little bare feet she slipped from bed
and went toward the casement, drawn by the moon-magic
to look upon the beauty her early bedtime had
left undiscovered.  Great dark masses of cloud floated
across the face of the golden disc, black on the side
that hung over the shadowy fields and woods, but
shining with a marvelous radiance where the
moonlight touched them from above.
</p>

<p>
The child had watched them floating, forming,
massing, until they had passed away to the horizon,
and left the moon, a floating ship of light, far, far
up in the sky, dimming the brilliance of the stars.
She had crept back to her little bed with a new sense
of things hitherto undreamed of in her childish
imaginings, yet never again to be entirely lost&mdash;a sense
of majesty, of order and immutability, of strange
beauty, and of the Greatness that kept watch while
she, a little child, safely slumbered.
</p>

<p>
The hour left its mark upon her entire life; and
now once more such an impression of security, of
beauty, and perhaps of destiny had been laid upon
her in the moment when she had faced his soul
through John Ogilvie's eyes.
</p>

<p>
There was no need to hasten further revelation.
Indeed, she did not wish for it.  She was more than
content to rest for a while in the calm of unspoken
assurance.  It was enough, as much as the hours
would hold, until they could grow used to it and
expand to the greater glory that was to come.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie, too, had something of the same sense of
uplift.  He, too, had had his revelation.  But,
man-like, he would have grasped at once at something
more definite, more dear, if he had not, with a lover's
keenness of intuition, seen that Rosamund was satisfied
to wait.  He had no fear, no misconception; he
felt, rather, a reverence which forbade his hastening
her toward the avowal which would bring the surrender
he so ardently desired.  The same force of love
which made him long for it, made him also too tender
to urge it.  His coming to the brown cottage every
day was too much a matter of custom to be remarked
upon.  There were Eleanor and Grace, Yetta and
Timmy to talk to, as well as Rosamund; and he fell
into the way of arriving in time for the mid-day
dinner, just as Tim fell into the way of waiting for him
with the announcement of what good things Aunt
Susan was going to give them to eat.  Rosamund
teased Ogilvie about it a little, but Eleanor, the
ostensible hostess, remembered the ancient person with
whom he lived, took pity on him, and kept him as
often as she could.  Indeed, Eleanor, like Mother
Cary, regarded him as an overgrown boy, very much
in need of maternal attentions; if she suspected the
state of affairs between him and Rosamund, she
tactfully gave no sign of it.  So Ogilvie came and went
as naturally as if he were a member of the household,
and his daily sight of Rosamund lent him patience.
</p>

<p>
But always he was on the watch for signs of the
distrust that still muttered against "the stranger
woman."  Grace's taking refuge in the brown house
had affected the mountaineers in two ways.  One
faction&mdash;for so strongly did each side feel that there
were, indeed, definite factions&mdash;held that Rosamund
had only offered her the shelter which any woman
would have given to another in such sore need, and
declared that all of Grace's friends were bound to
Rosamund by the obligation of gratitude.  The
other faction, and perhaps the larger, held that
if Grace had not actually betrayed her husband to
the authorities, she had run away from him and so
failed in her duty of hiding him, and that Rosamund
shared her guilt, if, indeed, she was not directly
responsible for it.  Mother Cary, whom all adored,
came in for a share of blame, for being friends with
the guilty ones, and even the doctor, though he was
known to be faithfully in sympathy with all his mountain
patients, and though no one suspected his integrity
toward them, found many faces turned away from
him which had hitherto shown only confidence and
affection.
</p>

<p>
That Rosamund was aware of the state of things
he could only guess; she gallantly denied any uneasiness,
although there were many evidences of the bad
feeling against her.  They were only trivial things,
little annoyances, surly answers, eyes that would not
see her; yet they told their story with unmistakable
plainness.
</p>

<p>
It was while things were in this unsettled state
that she was surprised by a second visit from Flood
and Pendleton; not, this time, in the car, for the
roads were impassable.  They drove up in the only
sleigh that was for hire at the Summit.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton had hardly got out of his great fur
coat before he opened fire; he had evidently come
primed.
</p>

<p>
"What's all this about arrests and moonshiners,
Rosamund?" he demanded.  "Cecilia's very uneasy.
Had a letter from her day before yesterday, saying
she'd come herself if she could do any good, and
wouldn't I run up and look around a bit.  So here we
are, both of us, because Flood wouldn't be left behind!"
</p>

<p>
"That wasn't quite fair of Cecilia," Rosamund
said, flushing angrily.  Pendleton had promptly got
on her nerves with the alacrity that only an old friend
is capable of.  "I thought I had made it plain that
I mean to be let alone."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please!" Flood, the peacemaker, besought
them; and Rosamund had come to like his helpless
"Oh, please!" so well that she smiled at him, though
her eyes were still bright with anger.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Pendleton," he went on, "you're always
trying to fight with Miss Randall."  Pendleton only
grinned at him.  "Really, Miss Randall, we haven't
come to interfere, not in the very least, I assure you!
Mrs. Maxwell did write; but we wanted very much
to see you.  That is why <i>I</i> came, anyway!"
</p>

<p>
So far he dared venture, and at the very bathos
of his distress Rosamund laughed, and peace reigned
again.  She told them of Tobet's arrest, and that his
wife was now a member of her household.  She
declared that there remained no possible danger, with
Joe out of the way.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton appealed to Eleanor; and Flood, too,
gave her a questioning look.  She could not hide her
anxiety; but that she was not afraid to admit it gave
Flood a feeling of security that he would have missed
if she had shown herself, like Rosamund, inclined to
deny the danger.  For Flood believed that the
newspaper accounts of trouble present and to come must
be the smoke of some fire; yet he feared only a
possible unpleasantness for Rosamund, rather than any
actual danger.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie came in while they were still discussing
it.  To-day there were no traces of tell-tale emotion
to be hidden.  He had seen the sleigh before the
house, guessed who were within, and now showed
himself unaffectedly glad to see Flood.  Rosamund
inwardly trembled lest Ogilvie should express
himself on the subject of the mountaineers' suspicions;
she could not know that a look, passed between
himself and Flood, was enough to set Flood on the alert.
</p>

<p>
She talked feverishly while they were at dinner,
and her heart sank when, afterwards, Pendleton
announced that he was hit with an idea.  He was
standing at the window, taking in the white sweeps and
stretches of snow, the black trunks of the leafless
trees, the dark pyramids of the spruces, the more
distant shadow of pines.
</p>

<p>
"Jove!" he cried.  "Just look at those slopes
for skiing and tobogganing!  It's better than Davos!"
</p>

<p>
Then he turned from the window, his hands deep
in his pockets, and stood in front of Rosamund, his
head on one side, tipping backward and forward
from heels to toes.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Rosy," he said, "the best way you can
convince us, and poor dear Cecilia, that you are safe
up here is to let us stay for a while and see for
ourselves!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund flushed; he was so wilfully provoking.
"Marshall!  How can you?  You know very well I
can't have two men in my house!  Why do you want
to make me appear so inhospitable?"
</p>

<p>
Flood, too, looked as if he would like to express
himself forcibly.  "Oh, I say, Pendleton&mdash;&mdash;" he
began.
</p>

<p>
But Ogilvie, apparently, saw something of good
in the suggestion.  "That's a capital idea, Mr. Pendleton,"
he said.  "Stay up here a while, and see for
yourselves.  I'll be very glad to put you up, if
Mrs. Reeves will invite us over to dinner once in a while!
My landlady isn't much of a chef!"
</p>

<p>
Flood had turned to him quickly, with a keen
look of questioning.  "Could you really, old man?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Bully!" Pendleton cried, grinning at Rosamund.
"Bet I can beat you in a snow fight, Rose!"
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund, biting her lip in dismay, would
not look at him.
</p>

<p>
"I can snow-fight!" Tim announced.  "I know
how to make a snow man, too!  My muvver showed me!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
XVII
</h3>

<p>
It ended in their remaining ten gala days.  Flood
telegraphed for the implements of winter sports,
and got them the next day.  They opened them on
the brow of the hill, and Pendleton, who took it upon
himself to be master of ceremonies, "dared"
Rosamund to lead off on the skis.
</p>

<p>
"What for is vey long sticks?" Tim asked.  And
when he saw Miss Rose walk off on them he shrieked,
and hid his face in Eleanor's skirts.
</p>

<p>
The entire household had come to look on.  Matt
and Sue stood at the corner of the cottage, he leaning
on a snow-shovel to keep him in countenance, Aunt
Sue with one apron over her turbaned head and her
hands rolled up in another.  Grace, as white as the
snow itself, sat bundled up in rugs on a sunny corner
of the piazza; Ogilvie had seen to that.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor and Rosamund were in scarlet caps and
long blanket coats.  When Pendleton had fastened
on her skis, Rosamund threw aside the coat, and
stood, a figure of white against the vaster white, save
for the red of her cap and the warm brightness of her
hair and face.
</p>

<p>
She had known many Alpine winters, and was as
much at home on skis and snowshoes as in a ball-room.
</p>

<p>
She turned away from the interested little group
to look across the unbroken slope gleaming in
sunlight that kissed it to a rosy glow in places, in others
turned its frozen crystals to a myriad sparkling
points of light.  In the hollows and under the
shadow of drifts and pines the snow looked blue.  She
knew where the fields lay, now under their blanket,
patterned by fences in the summer.  The road wound
off to the left, then down, down&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It was only a step or two to the crest of the hill;
the leap would be glorious!  She turned a laughing
glance over her shoulder; Eleanor, Ogilvie, Flood,
were watching her intently.
</p>

<p>
"I dare you!" Pendleton cried again; and she
was off, off in one splendid rush and leap, a leap that
carried her out and down, far down.
</p>

<p>
Again Timmy shrieked, and Yetta fell on her
knees.  Eleanor's face flushed in admiration, and
Pendleton called out,
</p>

<p>
"Good girl!  Never knew you to take a dare!"
</p>

<p>
It was a phase of her new to the two men who
loved her.  Ogilvie had seen her in many situations,
Flood in more; each believed that he knew the full
excellence of her, yet, oddly enough, neither had
thought of her as this wild, boyish, graceful creature
of the out-of-doors.  The sudden discovery of it came
as a shock to both; for both were by nature men of
the open, notwithstanding the fact of Flood's
accumulated millions and Ogilvie's eminence in the
laboratory.  Now, in their surprise, they stood above,
on the edge of the slope, and watched her, each
thrilling, each showing his emotion in his own way.
</p>

<p>
Flood, in his surprise, had called out, then thrust
one clenched fist into the other palm with a resounding
smack; but in a moment his face took on its
expressionless mask&mdash;expressionless save for the
gleam from the half-closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie had made no sound; he stood perfectly
still, with out-thrust under lip, the corners of his
eyes wrinkling to a smile; his face wore something
of the indulgent, restrained look of a mother when
she sees an adored child perform some wonder, yet
refrains from praise of that which is so intimately
her own; his first move was to run his fingers through
his hair.
</p>

<p>
The two stood there as if spellbound until
Rosamund reached the valley and waved up to them.
Then Flood and Ogilvie turned, and met each other's
eyes.  There was something of a shock; instantly
each looked away again, with an unspoken feeling of
apology, as if he had looked upon a disclosure that
was not meant for him.
</p>

<p>
Neither analyzed what he had seen; until that
moment neither had suspected that the thought of
Rosamund might be living in the heart and desire
of the other.  Instantly each put the suspicion aside,
as if it were an unworthy one; yet, through the hours
that followed, it persisted in returning again and
again.  Each man acknowledged that if it were true
of himself, it might well be true of his friend; but
each tried to assure himself of its impossibility, even
while admitting that, if it were true, there could have
been nothing of unfairness on the part of the other.
</p>

<p>
From their first meeting on the mountain-top
Flood and Ogilvie had intuitively liked each other.
Through a knowledge of varied types of men, they
had learned to look beneath the surface; each
recognized in the other many qualities to respect.  Men
are by nature hero-worshipers, from the time that
they look with covetous admiration on the policeman's
brass buttons and the motorman's thrilling
power, through the period when they worship the
home league's star pitcher and third-base-man, the
captain of their college foot-ball eleven, and on to
their political enthusiasms.  There is far more of
pure hero-worship in the friendships of men than the
world gives them credit for.  Flood and Ogilvie had
met on a mountain-top, and on a height their friendship
was to remain.  Each saw in the other "a
splendid fellow"; neither would have admitted in his
friend the least shadow of baseness.  So, after the
unforeseen disclosure of that look, each man felt
generously on his honor to appear unaware of any
possible feeling on the part of his friend toward
Rosamund, even going so far, in his heart and hopes, as to
deny that such might exist.
</p>

<p>
But while this ardent liking existed between Flood
and Ogilvie, there was something far different
between each of them and Pendleton.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton liked Flood.  He liked him for the
virile strength of his personality, as well as for his
possessions; he knew him only in his hours of leisure,
and might not have liked him so well, nor at all, if
he had known him only when he was engrossed in
business.  But toward Ogilvie he could not disguise
an antagonism which would have shown itself openly
if he had been more courageous, and which as it
was, appeared in countless small spitefulnesses.
</p>

<p>
To the man who does nothing there are no creatures
less interesting than those whose every moment
is taken up with affairs.  Between the deliberate idler
and the man of absorbing occupation there can be
nothing in common; indeed, there often arises more
or less antipathy.  The business man is apt to retain
a hearty disrespect for the idler; to him, the man of
leisure must always appear an anomaly, an excrescence,
a parasite of civilization.  And even when the
worker has developed toward the plane of the
connoisseur, the collector, the lover of sports and arts,
he seldom does more than tolerate the man who has
begun where he finds himself only toward the end of
an active career.
</p>

<p>
Yet Flood found Marshall amusing and likable
enough.  He was perfectly aware of Pendleton's
qualities of the sycophant, the flatterer, the gatherer
of crumbs from the rich man's table.  He thought of
them rather pityingly as a natural outgrowth of the
life of that class in which Pendleton was so much at
his ease, and regarded them leniently because he
believed that there was also to be found in that class
so much that was desirable, so much that he himself
coveted.  He was willing to accept its evil with its
good, its defects with its excellence; if it had brought
forth a Pendleton, it had also borne the perfect flower
that was Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
But to Ogilvie Pendleton was altogether an
abomination; he could see no good in him; his very
palms itched to smite him!
</p>

<p>
They were fortunate in their weather.  It seemed
as if nature, satisfied with her latest marvel, were
holding her breath.  Every day of their ten was
brilliantly clear and cold and windless.  Their voices
rang far across the white silence of valley and
mountain in that hushed atmosphere.  The frozen snow
crunched even under Timmy's little trudging feet;
and the mountain people apparently felt that it was
useless to lurk among the spruces when every step
they took told where they would be hidden.  They
came from far and wide to stare at the strange antics
of the "foreigners," and grinned at Rosamund, more
friendly than they had ever been before.
</p>

<p>
Pap drove Mother Cary across the valley to look
on at the sports; Rosamund called her attention to
the new friendliness of the other spectators.  The old
woman smiled rather grimly.  "Land!  No wonder!"
she said.  "Nobody could suspicion those
young fellers were spies, cuttin' up sech capers as
them, sliding down hill head foremost on their
stummicks, an' prancin' around on slappers.  I never saw
such goin's on, myself&mdash;and John Ogilvie one of 'em!"
</p>

<p>
They laughingly compared notes afterward, and
decided that Mother Cary had been quite scandalized
by their "capers;" Ogilvie admitted that she had
been very severe toward him the day after her drive
across the valley.
</p>

<p>
But for themselves they were glorious hours.
Rosamund threw aside the burden of care that had
enveloped her during the past weeks, and became as
merry as a child, more gay and joyous, than Ogilvie
had ever seen her.  She skimmed down the slopes on
her toboggan with Tim holding on behind her, his
curls blowing out in the onrush of their swift descent;
and she would carry him back up the hill again,
"pick-a-back," to show him how strong a horse she was.
She could outdistance them all on skis, but Ogilvie
proved himself the best on snowshoes&mdash;thanks to his
boyhood in northern Vermont, although Flood, who
had faced many a blizzard on the plains, was not far
behind him.
</p>

<p>
On the last day of the joyful ten Flood had gone
with Rosamund on snowshoes across the valley to
carry something to Mrs. Allen.  Snow had fallen
during the night, and every bough of pine and spruce and
fir had its burden of downy white.  The two paused,
when they had come past Father Cary's wood-lot, to
look down upon the valley.
</p>

<p>
They stood for a moment or so without speech.
Flood looked from the snow-covered fields to the face
beside him, as if to compare one loveliness with
another; then he drew a deep breath.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, as they went on again, "I'm
sorry to be leaving all this!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment she did not reply; she looked up at
him once or twice, and he divined that she had
something to say which she did not quite dare to put into
words.  They had become very good friends, thanks
to the freedom of the out-of-door life of the past
days.  He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, please!  Don't mind saying it!  I haven't
any feelings!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she protested, laughing, "I was not
dreaming of hurting your feelings!  I was only thinking
how&mdash;how curious it is that you should&mdash;should
care so much for what you are going back to."
</p>

<p>
But he did, nevertheless, show himself a little hurt
at that.  "Why shouldn't I like it?" he asked.  "Do
I seem such a savage?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, precisely not!"  Her mood was kind.
"You are not a savage.  You are very nice&mdash;I'm very
glad I've found out how nice you are.  But that's
just what makes me wonder, you see, how you can
like it!"
</p>

<p>
"Like being nice?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;of course not!  Like what you're going
back to.  New York.  Cecilia!  Oh&mdash;all of that&mdash;you
know what I mean, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," he said, a little puzzled, "I'm afraid I
don't see anything wrong with it&mdash;with your 'all of
that!'  Do you think I ought to?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it isn't so much what is wrong with it.  It's
only that it doesn't satisfy&mdash;does it?  It is
chaff&mdash;husks&mdash;a bubble&mdash;it has no substance."
</p>

<p>
He considered it for a moment.  Then he submitted:
"Has this?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, at least this has substance.  It isn't empty."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it?" he asked.  "Do you know, I should
just have reversed that opinion.  I should have said
there was a good deal more in the life you've deserted
this winter than in the life you're choosing to live
here!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "Perhaps I've reverted!  Or perhaps
we are in different phases of evolution!  You
have reached your&mdash;we'll call it your New York&mdash;and
I have passed through it and come on to something
better.  Or if that sounds impolite we'll say
that I have reached it and tumbled down again!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's no impoliteness in the truth!  You
are generations, infinite ages, ahead of me!"
</p>

<p>
She made no answer to his humility, and for a
while neither spoke again.  Their talk was, of
necessity, largely broken by intervals when all their
attention was needed for the task in hand.  The light
snow made the going uncertain; they were taking the
shorter way home, along the upper slopes, instead of
crossing the valley, and they had, more or less,
alternately to feel their way and to rush swiftly on across
possible dangers.
</p>

<p>
At the crest of the last slope Rosamund paused,
and they turned to look back at the way they had
come.  Flood watched her with eyes of devotion, as
she stood there with her head thrown a little upwards,
breathing deeply, her face warm with her delight in
the beauty of the scene before her.
</p>

<p>
"How lovely it is!" she said, in the vibrating
tone that always thrilled him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is lovely," he said, "but only for a time.
It is too much like the real thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it the real thing?" she asked, surprised.
</p>

<p>
He laughed, and shook himself a little.  "I mean
the real thing that I used to know, the drifts on the
plains, sleet in the face, the numbness in your feet that
tells you they're frozen&mdash;that's the real thing!
Believe me!"
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him, interested.  "And you
have really felt that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," he said.  "I've felt it&mdash;but it's a long
time ago.  I'm glad it is, too.  A very little of it
satisfies.  Nowadays my real thing is&mdash;well, what you
called a while ago, New York, though that's only a
manner of speaking, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  We've talked back in a circle!
I am still wondering why you like it as you do!"
</p>

<p>
They had crossed their last hummock, and had
come to the place not far from the brown house where
Matt now spread rugs and cushions every morning;
but no one was there to greet them.  Far down the
long slope of white they could see Eleanor and Tim,
moving slowly over the crust; Yetta was already at
home on snowshoes, and her crimson-clad figure was
skimming over the snow-covered fields.  Apparently
she was playing a game of ball with Pendleton&mdash;something
they had invented for themselves; Ogilvie,
also on snowshoes, was with them.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund sent a clear Valkyrie call down to
them.  They all looked up, and waved.  Ogilvie
moved closer to Pendleton's side, and the game of ball
went on.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund threw herself down on one of the
blankets, and Flood took his place beside her.  She
still wore her snowshoes, and sat with her knees
drawn up, her arms clasped about them, boy fashion.
She was watching the others at their game down
below, but Flood looked no farther than her face.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she became intensely aware of the man
beside her; she could not tell how the change came,
or whether there were a change at all, except in her
intense consciousness of him.  She did not turn to
look at him; she did not so much as tremble from her
position; but slowly, as if the blood were retreating
to her heart, her face grew white.
</p>

<p>
Flood saw the change in her face, and knew that
he was the cause of it.  His heart beat triumphantly
faster.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you say that you wonder at my
liking&mdash;New York?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She tried, vainly, to speak.
</p>

<p>
"You know what it represents, to me.  It's something
better than I ever had before.  It's friends, it's
music, and art, and the whirl on the Avenue.  It is
'up and on'&mdash;and&mdash;Rosamund, don't you know
what it is above all else?  It is you."
</p>

<p>
He had meant to say a great deal, when this
moment should have arrived; he had often wondered
just how it would come, when he should find courage
where they two should be.  He had tried to teach
himself the words he thought would be most sure to
move her, words that would best disclose the fullness
of his faith and his desire; yet now that the moment
for speaking was upon him he reverted to the man
that was his inmost self, forgetting his practiced
phrases, not speaking the words he had rehearsed, but
telling his longing in short, rushing sentences of
pleading, voicing to her silence the cry of the strong soul
to its chosen mate, the appeal, even the demand, of
the man who had won a high place to the woman
who could lead him up to even greater altitudes of the
spirit.  He pleaded as a man who has much to offer,
but who is yet begging for the crowning gift.
Unconsciously he disclosed his own greatness of soul,
while making her understand that he held her supreme,
beyond all that was beautiful, above all that
was high.
</p>

<p>
Before he was done speaking, her head had bent
itself until her face was on her knees.  Never had she
felt herself so unworthy; never had her humility been
so great.  Yet when he paused, she did not answer;
even for his last strong appeal she had no word.  He
had shown her the depths of his heart, and hers was
shaken to its own depths.  But yield she could not,
turn to him she could not.  It was as if two great
elemental forces met, and clashed, and refused to
combine.  She could not altogether repudiate his
appeal, yet she must be true to the stronger one which
held possession of her heart.
</p>

<p>
As he watched her in a silence that seemed still
to vibrate with the strength of his words, she raised
her head to look at the figures now coming toward
them up the long slope.  Suddenly she saw that Ogilvie
stopped short, and, apparently at some word from
Pendleton, looked up toward herself and Flood.  He
took a hesitating step or two, came on at a wave
from Pendleton; then he turned away, leaving the
others to return without him.
</p>

<p>
Some silent message had come up the mountain to
her; Rosamund had found her answer to poor Flood.
The others were out of sight for the moment behind
a low growth of pine; only Ogilvie was visible
as he made his way along the other ridge, taking his
steps heavily, seeming suddenly to have become
weary.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund watched him for a moment; then she
turned her white face, pitiful with the knowledge of
the hurt that she must give him, toward Flood.  He
must have read something there, for, startled, he bent
a little closer; then, following her look, he glanced
from her to Ogilvie, and back again.  Her eyes did
not waver from him, and when they had to answer the
question in his, the paleness left her face, and a great
wave of color flooded it.  He held his breath, and his
unspoken question must have become imperative; for
she nodded, her parted lips refusing to form words.
Then, withdrawing her look, she hid her face in her
arms.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them ever realized that she spoke no
word at all.  Her reply had been too well-defined to
need speech.  Flood understood.
</p>

<h3>
XVIII
</h3>

<p>
The morning after the departure of Flood and
Pendleton, Eleanor and Rosamund went out to
the veranda for their usual after-breakfast "breath of
air," and stood arm in arm, looking over the long
slopes which had been the theater of their wonderful
ten days' sport.  Apparently the same thought came
to them simultaneously.  They looked at each other
and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever see any place so empty?" Eleanor
asked.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund shook her head.  "I never did," she
said.  "Isn't it absurd?"
</p>

<p>
"It's like being in a room when the clock stops!"
said Eleanor, and Rosamund laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it curious how much of the city feeling
those two brought with them?  Before they came I
felt as if New York were miles&mdash;oh, continents&mdash;away.
This place was home, the center of the universe.
Now&mdash;well, now this is 'way off in the country'!"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor laughed understandingly.  "I know!
And yet not once while they were here did we do
anything we should have done in town!  No one so much
as mentioned bridge!"
</p>

<p>
"It must have been Marshall's presence," said
Rosamund.  "Certainly Mr. Flood never suggests
town to me!"  She flushed, remembering what their
last talk of New York had led to.  He had taken it
so well, proved himself so completely the master of
his emotions, shown her so gently that he held her
blameless and still supreme, that she had never liked
him so much as after having shown him how little she
liked him!
</p>

<p>
Eleanor looked at her curiously, for she suspected
something of what had passed the day before; but she
had cause to look at her wonderingly more and more,
in the days that followed, days which, for Rosamund,
soon became filled with mixed emotions.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see my doctor," Tim said at dinner
one day.
</p>

<p>
The three women looked at one another as if it
had just occurred to them that Ogilvie had not,
indeed, been to the brown cottage that day, nor the day
before, nor the one before that.  Nearly a week in
fact, had passed since the departure of the two men,
and not once in that time had White Rosy stopped
before the house.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he has not been here since Mr. Flood left!
He must be ill," said Eleanor, trying to speak as if
the idea had just occurred to her.
</p>

<p>
"No, he ain't," said Yetta, always willing to give
information.  "I saw him driving around by the
other road yesterday.  He ain't sick."
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's five days since he was here," Grace
said.  "He must 'a' forgot you, Timmy!"
</p>

<p>
Tim's lip began to tremble, and he turned to the
ever ready Eleanor to be comforted.
</p>

<p>
It had been a week of restlessness for Rosamund.
The visit of Flood and Pendleton had recalled enough
of the old familiar atmosphere of cities to make the
solitude of the mountains seem strange.  She had been
so sure that the new life was the best one!  Now she
was disgusted with herself to find that something of
the old restlessness had returned.  She told herself,
with increasing determination, as the empty days wore
on, that she had become dissatisfied with the pleasant
monotony of the new life because a breath of the old
one had blown toward her.  For her admission to
Flood, drawn from her unawares, as it had been, even
before Ogilvie himself had demanded it, gave her a
self-consciousness which was hard to bear.  But
apparently her secret was to remain with Flood.
Ogilvie did not come to claim it.  It had long become his
habit to stop at the cottage whenever he passed there.
For the first few days of his absence, she was only
sorry that he did not find time to come.  She could
have no doubts of him.  For weeks she had been
happily sure that he was only waiting for a sign from her
to put into words what his eyes and manner were
always saying.  To have doubted him would have
been to doubt the foundations of the world.
</p>

<p>
But gradually she became anxious at his prolonged
absence.  All sorts of womanish fears began
to crowd upon her.  Although for a long time she
had heard no mutterings of trouble from among the
mountaineers, yet now she imagined all sorts of
horrors, with Ogilvie as their victim.  When Mother
Cary told her, one day, that the doctor certainly must
be sick, her fears went beyond bounds.  She knew
herself to be his own, she believed him to be hers;
courageously she ignored her maidenly hesitancies, and
went forth to meet him.
</p>

<p>
All night she had lain awake nerving herself to
seek him out; but when morning brought the hour of
their meeting she forgot everything save her anxiety
for him.  She had convinced herself that he was in
trouble, and staying away so that no shadow of it
should fall on her.
</p>

<p>
She knew which way White Rosy would bring
him.  It was snowing, but she put on her warm red
coat and cap, and went quietly out of the house,
walking down the road toward the Summit, to meet his
sleigh on its way to the valley.  She waved to him
when he came in sight, but apparently he did not see
her; as he drew nearer she waved again, and called.
</p>

<p>
He answered, for such a greeting had passed
between them many times before, and was not to be
ignored.  But when the sleigh stopped beside her she
cried out at the drawn whiteness of his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried, her hand over her heart, "you
are ill!"
</p>

<p>
But he managed to smile, and threw aside his
worn old fur rug with an inviting gesture.  "Ill?
Not a bit of it!  Let me give you a lift to the
cottage!"
</p>

<p>
Mechanically she took her place beside him, and
he urged White Rosy on.  She looked at him with
anxious eyes and parted lips, feeling all the while as
if she were in some bewildered dream, where the real
was unreal, where everything was distorted&mdash;like
itself, yet strangely unlike.
</p>

<p>
Always before they had talked as fancy led them,
or were comfortably silent; now he was so unlike
himself as to manufacture small-talk, commonplaces,
nothings.  There was no reference to his not having
been to the cottage, no hint of having missed her, no
least word, in fact, of anything personal between
them.  He talked on, almost feverishly, without
looking at her, while she sat there numbly, dazed at the
change in him, but wounded far beyond other thought
or speculation.
</p>

<p>
He stopped the sleigh in front of the brown house,
and she got down without looking at him; and still
without speaking she went inside.  He had not so
much as suggested her driving on with him, as she had
done half a hundred times before!
</p>

<p>
Grace, in a deep basket chair, was smilingly
watching the pretty group before the fire&mdash;Eleanor,
teaching the two children how to pop corn, with Tim
on her knee vigorously shaking the wire basket.  They
looked up as Rosamund entered, and at sight of the
girl's face Eleanor put Timmy quickly down from her
lap and jumped up, with a little anxious cry.
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund blindly, unheeding, went past them
and up to her own room.  She closed the door and
locked it, and made some incoherent answer to
Eleanor's entreaties.  She never knew how long she sat
there, silent, motionless, without removing her hat or
coat, dumbly trying to control the mingled shame and
longing that surged through her.  Vainly she searched
through her memory for an explanation; she had done
nothing to offend him, no least thing that should
estrange him.  Even now she could not believe that he
would wantonly hurt her; her faith in their love had
rooted itself too deep in her heart to be easily
disturbed.
</p>

<p>
At last she called upon her pride for help, only to
find that pride itself lay sorely wounded.  But it was
that which enabled her at last to lay aside hat and
coat, to bathe her face and rearrange her hair, even
to dress herself in her most becoming gown&mdash;that
sure refuge of a suffering woman!&mdash;and go downstairs
to meet Eleanor's questioning, anxious eyes.  It
was not until Ogilvie came back later in the day, for
a hasty call at an hour when he knew the entire household
would be assembled, that anger came, mercifully,
to her relief.  She saw that he wished to make it seem
as if he had always come at that hour, as if his visits
were habitually that far apart; she understood that he
was determined to make it impossible for her to ask
wherein he suspected her of offense.  He meant to
give her no opportunity to explain or demand explanation;
instead, he was taking this way of turning back
the hands of the clock.  He was deliberately
withdrawing from their intimacy, putting their friendship
back upon a plane of formality.  It would seem as if
he were trying to show her that his feelings had
changed.  Yet she had faced her own love too frankly,
in her heart's secret communings, to be able to
deny it now.  She could only, in an agony of shame,
tell herself at last that she had been deceived in his.
</p>

<p>
The days that followed were full of misery for
her.  All her life she had been the center of a little
world of love and admiration.  For the first time some
one had turned from her; the pain of it was not
lessened because the one who spurned her had come to
hold first place in her heart.  Yet such was her
attitude that not even Eleanor dared say a word which
might touch upon the subject ever so remotely.
Eleanor did, indeed, watch her with yearning eyes, and
Rosamund, sensitive in her suffering, believed that she
talked of her with Grace and Mother Cary; but it was
only by their avoidance of Ogilvie's name that they
showed any suspicion of what was in her heart.  Had
Eleanor dared to speak, Rosamund would not have
been able to silence her; for she needed every atom
of her strength to appear unconscious and natural
whenever Ogilvie came.  She would not avoid him.
She could only be feverishly gay before him; and
Eleanor noticed how much more grimly his face set
itself after each visit.
</p>

<p>
The weeks passed, quickly for the rest of the
household, slowly enough for Rosamund.  She took
long walks with Yetta; as Grace grew in strength she
went with them, taking them to call on her mountain
friends, who had shown themselves more friendly
toward Rosamund since they had watched her at
play&mdash;and since the arrest of Joe Tobet, always a
disturbing personality.  They came to see Grace at the
brown house, where Rosamund made them feel at
home, and gave them coffee and cake and talked to
them about their children, and loaned them patterns,
which she bought for the purpose, and which Eleanor
showed them how to use.  Rosamund's greatest comfort
lay in the fact that she was coming to be of use
to them, thus fulfilling the desire which had been her
excuse for remaining among them.
</p>

<p>
For other exercise she had no desire; she could
not put on snowshoes or skis without recalling a time
which she was trying to forget; besides, she had no
heart for play.  And soon even the walks became not
unalloyed pleasure.  Although no further warnings
had come, either to herself or Grace, and although
the mountain people continued to show themselves
more and more friendly, Rosamund was conscious of
a feeling of uneasiness, a dread of ominous, unseen
horrors hovering near, of stealthy presences following
her, of eyes peering at her from the leafless undergrowth
or through the branches of the scrub pine.
She tried to persuade herself that it was all a part of
the foolish imaginings of a timid woman, yet had to
admit that she had never been timid before; gradually
the feeling of uneasiness became almost unbearable,
in her increasing nervousness.
</p>

<p>
She welcomed the relief of Christmas, although it
was Eleanor who went to New York for their Christmas
shopping.  Rosamund resolved with herself that
she would not leave the Summit until she had
overcome the vague fear that was now present with her
whenever she left the house.  She would conquer that,
or find out the reason for it, even though the relations
between herself and Ogilvie were at an end forever.
So she sent Eleanor in her place, reigning alone for
two weeks in the house which had come to seem more
Eleanor's than her own.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor returned on Christmas eve, all prepared
to be a most munificent Santa Claus.  It was only
after the tree was trimmed, and they had filled
bulging stockings for everybody&mdash;including the Carys and
John Ogilvie&mdash;that she had a moment alone with
Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
At last, however, Grace went upstairs, and Sue
and Matt beamingly bade them good night; Tim had
not yet awakened with the first of his repeated
demands to go downstairs and see whether "Santy"
had come.  Eleanor threw herself wearily into a big
chair, and Rosamund perched on its arm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, who did you see, and where did you go,
and what did you do?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor laughed.  "I saw Mrs. Maxwell, for
one, and she was looking exceedingly pretty and
youthful."
</p>

<p>
"Was she in a good humor?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she invited me to luncheon!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then she was!  I suppose she had gotten my
Christmas check.  I've sent to Tiffany's for some
emeralds for her, besides.  She'll get them as a
surprise, to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
"Emeralds!  How munificent you are!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed.  "I'm afraid I'm only following
the line of least resistance, Eleanor!  Cissy's
an angel when she's pleased.  But didn't you see her
more than once?"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor's pause was scarcely perceptible.  "Mr. Flood
asked us all to dinner at the Ritz," she said.
</p>

<p>
"How nice of him!  You and Cissy&mdash;and Marshall,
I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you saw them together.  Tell me, Eleanor,
do Cissy and Marshall really care for each other,
do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear!  Don't ask me such a question
as that!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  I've wondered sometimes whether
they would marry, if there were more money between
them.  I'd like Cissy to be happy; but, of course,
she'd have to be happy in her way!"  She thought for
a while, then added, "Marshall intimated that 'dear
Cecilia' was setting her cap for Mr. Flood!  What
do you think about that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think anything at all, and it's bed-time,"
Eleanor answered, trying to rise.
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund's arm across her shoulder restrained
her.  "Not yet!  I want a long talk.  I have
missed you so dreadfully, old precious!"
</p>

<p>
Eleanor reached up for the hand on her shoulder,
and looked up into the girl's face.  "I didn't miss
you, sweet!  I took you with me!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed, more joyously than in weeks.
"Oh, what a lover-like speech from Eleanor!" she
cried.  "Who has been coaching you?"
</p>

<p>
It was the most innocent of questions; but instantly
Eleanor's usual whiteness vanished.  A wave
of pink crept up from her throat to her cheeks, to
her temples, to the line of her gold hair.  Rosamund
watched, amazed beyond expression.  Then Eleanor
sprang up.
</p>

<p>
"We really must go to bed!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
But Rosamond had her by the shoulders.
"Eleanor!" she gasped.  "Why&mdash;Eleanor&mdash;who?"
</p>

<p>
But Eleanor had broken away, and was running
up the stairs, leaving Rosamund to a bewilderment
which ended in a little gasp of understanding and
delight.

<h3>
XIX
</h3>

<p>
The first weeks of the new year passed rather
drearily.  Christmas had been a day of disappointment
for her, although she threw herself into the
carefully planned festivities with a feverish gayety.
The Carys had come across the valley to see the tree,
and before dinner-time every gift had found its way
to the one it was intended for, except the big net
stocking which the children had filled for the doctor.
He had promised Tim to come that morning; yet the
day passed without him.  He sent word that he was
called over the mountain; yet, legitimate though the
excuse was, Rosamund became gayer than before&mdash;for
anger always acted as a goad to her self-control.
</p>

<p>
After Christmas his calls grew farther and farther
apart; sometimes a week passed without his coming
at all.  When they met upon the road their greeting
was cheerful enough&mdash;too cheerful!  Eleanor
watched her, wondered, and said nothing.  Rosamund
was aware that something new had come into her
friend's life, and rejoiced, for Eleanor fell into the
way of wanting to go for the mail; or if any one else
brought it, she would take the letter that was
addressed to herself in a characteristic handwriting that
Rosamund knew, and ran off with it to read it alone.
Had it not been for Grace's growing need of her, and
for the new friendliness of the mountain people,
Rosamund would have deserted the brown house, for a
time at least.  But the increasing confidence of her
neighbors was unmistakable; and she told herself that
she would remain throughout the winter, if only to
prove John Ogilvie's forebodings wrong.
</p>

<p>
But all the while, as time passed, more and more,
on her walks and in her own house at night, she was
becoming haunted with that feeling of being watched
and followed.  She spoke of it to no one.  Grace
alone, her most constant companion, might have
offered some explanation; but Joe Tobet's trial was
approaching, and Grace was in no condition to be
needlessly alarmed.  Mother Cary was showing
herself increasingly anxious about Ogilvie; and the
teething grandchild kept her away from home much
of the time.  So Rosamund confided in no one; but
especially whenever she was out alone, or towards
twilight, she was possessed by the sense of a shadowy
something watching, following, haunting her.  It
amounted to an obsession, a fear that was all the more
terrifying because it could not be faced.  She tried to
persuade herself that it was a trick of overwrought
nerves, a wild phantasy of the imagination; and the
better to convince herself of that she laid little
traps&mdash;sprinkling fresh snow over the path to the house, for
one thing, only to find a man's footprints on it in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
When the time came that she would wake in the
night in horror, from a dream of something unseen
creeping upon her out of the dark, she knew that she
must somehow find and face the elusive presence,
whatever it might be, or become utterly unnerved.
Moved by the impulse of a frightened creature at bay,
she had tried to do so before, but in vain; now,
however, in her determination she laid a plan which was
more likely to succeed.
</p>

<p>
There were two ways from the brown house to
the post-office; by the road it was a countryman's long
mile, and until the leaves fell she had not discovered
that there was a shorter way by one of the hidden
paths worn by the mountaineers.  This little path ran
along beside the highway at times, though higher up
on the mountain-side, so that anyone walking upon it
could look down, unseen, on the road; now and again
it cut across turns, through woods, often with sharp
turnings to avoid some bowlder or fallen tree.
</p>

<p>
Although at the thought of it her heart beat with
something more closely related to fear than she cared
to admit, Rosamund determined to take the little
frozen path, and when she felt the presence lurking
back of her to turn, at one of the points where the
path bent aside, and, her movements hidden by the
nature of the path, to retrace her steps and face
whatever was following her.
</p>

<p>
At first she thought the Thing must in some
ghostly way have divined her purpose; all the way to
the Summit she knew that she was unfollowed.  But
on the way back, scarcely had she turned into the path
when her heart gave a leap.  There was the sound,
so detestably familiar of late, of a stealthy footstep,
which stopped when hers did, and which came on,
quietly, relentlessly, when she started forward again.
Nerving herself to courage, she walked quickly on
until she came to a place where the path turned
sharply; there for a moment or two she paused, to let the
pursuer gain upon her, then quietly and quickly
retraced her steps.
</p>

<p>
The ruse was successful.  She could hear the footsteps
come on, the man plainly unaware of her returning.
Suddenly she stepped a little out of the path and
waited.  The man came nearer, was opposite her&mdash;and
with a cry, her hand on her heart, she faced&mdash;John
Ogilvie.
</p>

<p>
For a long minute they stared at each other.  She
could scarcely believe the evidence of her eyes, yet it
was surely Ogilvie.  "Is it you who have been
following me?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
His shoulders drooped as guiltily as a schoolboy's
caught in mischief; he looked at her dumbly, wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;it&mdash;Yes!" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she could not speak, so amazed
was she.  When she did, he flushed deeply at the
scorn in her voice, but at once grew pale again.
</p>

<p>
"Has it amused you to frighten me?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
He took off his cap, and ran his fingers through
his hair in the old perturbed gesture.  There was a
pale intensity of yearning on his face, a dark gleam of
hungering pain, something of the bewildered misery
of the lost child, an agony of renunciation with none
of that exaltation which makes renunciation beautiful.
Despite the sharp cold of the closing day he looked
hot, disheveled, as one hard pressed.  His breath came
quickly and painfully, as if he had been running a
race.  Every vestige of color left his face as he stood
there, his look not faltering from hers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how could you do it?" she cried, tears
starting to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think you knew," he said, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"Not know?  Not know!" she gave a little
laugh that was half a sob.  "I have gone in terror&mdash;for
weeks!"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry," was all he found strength to say;
and it seemed as if the words could scarcely pass his
lips.
</p>

<p>
In the sudden revulsion of feeling she was becoming
shaken with anger.  He saw that she misjudged
him; but she had never seemed to him so beautiful
as in her scorn and anger and resentment.  The
appeal of her beauty only added to his distress.  The
moment was as tense as that earlier one when their
hearts had been disclosed; but now no one came to
break the spell.  Instead, Rosamund turned, and
walked away from him.
</p>

<p>
He had believed, during these weeks, that he had
schooled himself to silence and restraint; but she
heard him call, hoarsely, chokingly,
</p>

<p>
"Rosamund!  I had to&mdash;know you were safe!  I
had to&mdash;see you!"
</p>

<p>
Then, for her, the world threw off the horror that
had befogged it for weeks, and once more opened to
light and life.  Anger, resentment, doubt, all&mdash;all
were swept away at his cry, were as if they had never
existed.  She heard the love in his voice, and with a
little answering cry of her own she turned and ran
toward him.  Shyness and restraint had no place in
this new happiness.
</p>

<p>
In a moment she would have been in his arms, for
they were opened toward her.  But before she had
quite reached him he threw them upward, across his
face, as if to shut off the sight of her, and with a cry
she could never forget turned and ran, stumbling
down from the little path to the highway, crashing
through the bushes, running, running, in the desperate
haste of a man fleeing from temptation, over the
frozen ruts, sometimes stumbling, almost falling,
recovering, running still&mdash;running away from her.
</p>

<p>
She could never tell how she got back to the
cottage, how she found her way to her own room
through the blind agony of the hour.  What stood
between them she could not surmise; yet now she
knew, beyond all doubt, that he loved her.  His cry
still rang in her ears.  There might remain wonder,
distress, sorrow, even separation; but doubt had been
forever swept away.
</p>

<p>
Somehow she got through the evening, and, later,
slept.  She awoke before dawn as if someone were
calling; and, as in answer, she slipped from the bed
and went to her window.  She thrust her feet into her
fur-lined bedroom slippers; the heavy coat she used
for driving lay across a chair; she fastened it around
her, and turned the full collar up about her bare white
throat.  The air was very cold, but so still that it held
no sting.  Over the sleeping whiteness of the valley,
the snowy steeps of the lower hillsides, the dark crests
of the mountains, myriads of stars shone with a pale
radiance more lovely far than moonlight.  Mother
Cary's lamp burned, small and clear, on the side of
the opposite mountain, which at night seemed so like
a huge crouching beast; little farmsteads in the valley
and the nearer cottages were alike dark and slumbering
patches of shadow.  She watched the steady brilliance
of a planet pass towards the horizon and sink
over the mountain.  A star fell.  After a while, from
somewhere far away, a cock crowed.  The earth was
waiting for the day.
</p>

<p>
Then a subtle change began.  The stars grew
dim; the sky deepened its blue, and again slowly
paled.  The western mountains were faintly crowned
with light, and under the base of those to the
eastward shadows gathered more closely.  Again a cock
called, and was answered from near at hand.  Over
the eastern mountain tops an iridescent wave of color
spread upward.  So still was the air, so silent lay the
earth, that it might have been the expectant hush of
creation, the quiet of some new thing forming in the
Thought which gives love birth.  Dawn was there;
and through the stillness something stirred, or dimly
echoed; almost a pulse it seemed, or the first faint
throbs of life.  Then gaining strength, or coming
nearer, the sound came up to her more clearly.  She
knew where the road lay, white on white; along its
winding lift something was moving.  Surely the
sound came from there!  Nearer, more clearly, beat
upon beat, she heard it.  At last she made out the
form, and watched it with straining eyes and heart
that yearned toward it.
</p>

<p>
From some night errand of ministration his old
white mare was wearily bringing him homeward.

<p>
Yetta, a pretty girlish figure in soft gray, was
leaning on the rail of the box, lost in the absorption
of her first opera.  For three or four exciting days
they had been in the city, and Yetta felt as if she had
been swept into fairyland.  Everything was wonderful.
Miss Randall had blossomed into a princess in
marvelous raiment.  The most beautiful lady in the
world, Miss Randall's sister, had taken her to shops
and bought her various garments as fine as Miss
Randall's own.  She had been whirled about in warm,
closed automobiles.  Footmen at whom, less than a
year ago, she would have been pleased to smile, had
opened doors for her while she haughtily passed
through, outwardly oblivious of their magnificence.
Miss Randall's friends, while they asked various
questions about her as if she had possessed neither
eyes nor ears, were mostly very kind and gentle to her.
It was wonderful, and Yetta felt that the greatest day
of her life had been the one when Miss Randall,
coming down to breakfast, had surprised them all by
declaring that she was going to New York that afternoon
for a week or two, that Yetta was to accompany
her, and that neither Mrs. Reeves, nor Grace, nor
Timmy, nor Aunt Sue, nor Matt must divulge to a
soul among their neighbors that she had gone, because
she would be back before they had had time to think
twice about it.  And the crowning glory of it all was
this, that to-night she was in the great Opera House
in a box, leaning out toward the stage, and listening,
listening, listening!  She was certainly herself, Yetta;
but it seemed as if she must also be someone
else&mdash;someone in a lovely soft gray gown to whom Miss
Randall's friends, coming into the box from time to
time, bowed formally, as if she were a lady, and asked
how she was enjoying herself; and quite secretly,
though with all the intensity of her soul and her
imagination she knew it, she was still another person
who should, some day, be there on the stage, charming
these hundreds of people as she herself was now
bewitched, by the joy and beauty of a voice&mdash;her
voice, Yetta's!  But to-night it was enough to be a
fairy princess!
</p>

<p>
Rosamund had not stopped to speculate upon
Yetta's readiness for the great experience until they
were on the north-bound train, on the day after her
last encounter with Ogilvie.  Her own need had been
too pressing to admit of any other speculation or
demand.  She knew, when she turned back from the
window after her vigil of the dawn, that she must get
away for a time, away from the very thought of him,
if she was to be able to continue to think at all.  So
she had bound the remaining members of the household
to secrecy, and, with Yetta, started for New
York.
</p>

<p>
The girl was really presentable, she thought.  A
child of no other race could have adjusted herself so
quickly to the new demands; she believed that Yetta
was now ready for a wider horizon, for she spoke and
moved so well that Rosamund was sure even Cecilia's
fastidiousness could find little fault in her.  She meant
to give her a glimpse of the larger world, to have her
voice "tried" by a competent critic, and then to
return to the little brown house, perhaps with a
governess for the girl, someone who could do more for
her education than the little school-teacher.  At any
rate, the trip would give her time to recover herself,
to think, perhaps to decipher something of the puzzle
of John Ogilvie's conduct.
</p>

<p>
So, to-night, Yetta was listening to her first opera,
and Cecilia was chattering away at her side, their
friends coming in from time to time to greet the
returned one.  It all seemed as unreal to Rosamund as
to Yetta, so sudden had been the transposition.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton came late into a box across the semi-circle;
Cecilia shrugged and pretended to be unaware
of him.  It was the first time Rosamund had seen him
since her return, and she was beginning to wonder
with some amusement whether he had transferred his
attentions from Cecilia of his own accord or at the
lady's suggestion, when she saw him hastily borrow
his hostess's glass, take one look through it, and dart
from the box.  She knew what was coming.
</p>

<p>
"Rosy!" he cried, with his familiar impertinence,
only grinning at Cecilia, who in turn just raised
her eyebrows and became absorbed in the aria.  But
he, unabashed, bent over Rosamund.  "Rosy!  It
can't be you!  And&mdash;by all the saints, is that, is that
the creature who yelped at Benny a few short months
ago?"
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet," Rosamund whispered, laughing, in
spite of herself, at his nonsense.  "Don't be so
absurd, Marshall!"
</p>

<p>
"Absurd!" he cried, in mock indignation.  "Is
it absurd to greet the dawn?  Here we've all been
living in the darkness of your absence, and now you're
back at last, and you tell me not to be absurd!  I like
that!"
</p>

<p>
At his voice Yetta had turned for an instant to
smile a recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens!" he whispered, "what have
you done to her?"
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to what I am going to do," Rosamund
told him.  "But you are not to make love to
Yetta, my dear Marshall; I'm not going to have the
child told she's beautiful.  Who knows but she might
take you in earnest?"
</p>

<p>
Pendleton grinned cheerfully, and drew a little
chair to her side.  "All right, my dear," he said, "I
won't say 'boo' to her!"
</p>

<p>
There were other visitors off and on, but for two
acts he flagrantly deserted the woman he had come
with, and sat back of Rosamund's chair, talking over
her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"How's Eleanor?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund thought of Eleanor in the quiet room
in the brown house, while she was here, with the song
of the goose-girl in her ears&mdash;and her heart warmed
as our hearts are apt to warm toward those we have
left behind.
</p>

<p>
"Eleanor is well, and lovelier than ever," she
told him.
</p>

<p>
Pendleton screwed up his face.  "You aren't the
only one who thinks she is lovely, old lady!  If you
don't watch out she'll spike your guns with Benny!
He followed her around like Mary's lamb when she
was up before Christmas; and I've known too many
men and women in my time, Rosy dear, to believe
they found nothing better to do than to sing your
praises!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund looked at him, and smiled tantalizingly.
"Oh, we all know how experienced you are, Marshall,"
she teased him.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you ask after Flood?" he pursued,
ignoring her taunt; she smiled, and meekly said,
"Well, how is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Bloody-thirsty!" he said, in a sepulchral tone.
</p>

<p>
"What?" she laughed.  "What on earth do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Fact.  He's had a lust for killing, a sort of
Berserker rage against everything and everyone, ever
since we got back from your place, except while your
Eleanor was here.  Finally he got into a regular fury
with me, said he'd do various things to me&mdash;sort of
speech you'd expect from a navvy, you know.  Queer
how those fellows revert.  I told him to go west and
shoot wild beasts, and, d'you know, he took me at
my word!  Now what do you think of that?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was greatly amused.  "I think everyone
ought to take your word with a grain of salt,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head at her with mock reproach.
"What makes you so incredulous, Rose?" he asked,
sadly.  "It's a lamentable trait in a woman!"
</p>

<p>
"I, at least, don't fly into rages with you," she
retorted.
</p>

<p>
At that, he put on an air of intense depression.
"It's well you don't," he said.  "Two rages on your
account are enough."
</p>

<p>
"On my account?  Two?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, yes, wholly on your account.  You little
know, Rosamund, what I've tried to do for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Marshall, you are too absurd!"
</p>

<p>
"Now there's that lamentable trait of yours
again, Rose!  Really, it's time you came down from
your mountains, if that's what they do to you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Marshall, I'll believe anything you
tell me!  What have you been doing now?"
</p>

<p>
He drew his chair a little closer to hers, and
lowered his voice to a more confidential tone.
"Rosamund, I'm a misunderstood man," he said,
mournfully.  "Whenever I try to do anything for you,
people seem to turn against me.  Now there's
Cecilia&mdash;look at those shoulders, will you?  Did you ever
see anything so frigid?  Make me feel as if there's
a draught on my neck, just to look at them.  That's
the way she treats me, ever since I told her to let
Flood alone, because he's your preserve!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund laughed; the mystery was made clear.
"Good gracious, Marshall!  You never did that?"
</p>

<p>
But he pretended the utmost seriousness.  "That
wasn't all," he declared.  "One day I tried to jolly
Benny along, cheer him up a bit, you know!  He'd
been so awfully down.  I tried to tell him something
about the best fruit hanging high, that there was nothing
like perseverance, and all that sort of thing.  He
told me to mind only my own business.  Yes, he
really did, Rose!  Wasn't it perfectly shocking of
him?  I told him it was, and he said he'd like to
knock some sense into me.  That's when I suggested
his going off and shooting things."
</p>

<p>
"You had a fortunate escape," she said dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, hadn't I?" he agreed.  "But something
disagreeable always happens when I try to do you a
kindness, Rose!  There was that chap Ogilvie; he
seemed to turn against me from the moment I put him
wise."
</p>

<p>
At the unexpected mention of the name, her heart
seemed to stand still; but a flash of insight warned her
that she was upon the clue to the mystery that had
so tormented her.  She managed to smile at Pendleton,
and to ask, "How was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that last afternoon, you know, you've no
idea how well you and Benny looked, seated up there
on that red blanket.  I called Ogilvie's attention to
it&mdash;awfully hard to make conversation with a fellow
like him, you know.  I said something about you and
Flood being well suited to each other, and he seemed
rather surprised, and actually had the nerve to ask
me what I meant.  The way he spoke, or something,
put it into my head that he&mdash;er&mdash;he&mdash;well, that I
would be doing you a good turn by telling him a thing
or two.  I did."
</p>

<p>
"What?" she managed to ask, to his dramatic pause.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I believe I said that you and Flood must
be finding it very good to be together these few days;
that of course nothing had been announced yet, and
something of that sort.  I remember he said I must
be misinformed, which quite provoked me.  A fellow
doesn't like to be contradicted, you know.  What?  I
assured him I was in a position to know, and threw
in a word or two about your&mdash;er&mdash;millions being
joined to Benny's, or something of that sort.  Most
combative chap, Ogilvie!  Tried to tell me that a
woman of your type would not be likely to stay up
in the mountains so far from a fiancé.  'Pon my word,
I almost thought the fellow must be really hit,
himself!  I said he probably hadn't had much experience
with women of your type; never can tell what freak
you girls will take to next.  Oh, we had quite a word
or two, I assure you.  Ended in his being huffy.
Wouldn't walk up the hill beside me, and all that,
you know.  What?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund was never more grateful in her life
than to the unsuspecting man whose coming into the
box ended Pendleton's chatter.  During the rest of
the evening she dared not let herself think of his
revelations.  On the way home, however, she made
herself sure of the truth of part of them.
</p>

<p>
"What happened between Marshall and Mr. Flood?"
she asked Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell gave an exclamation of impatience.
"Oh, my dear!  Marshall has been altogether
too insufferable!  Mr. Flood has spoiled him.
He got to the point where he thought he owned
Mr. Flood.  Oh, yes, there was a fight, of course."  She
raised her eyebrows towards Yetta, who, opposite
them, was peering out at the receding street-lights
with eyes still bright with wonder.  Rosamund,
catching the signal, said,
</p>

<p>
"It is perfectly safe to talk."
</p>

<p>
Then Cecilia, rather more circumstantially than
Pendleton, told her of the triangular quarrel.  "And
now," she said, "Marshall is absurd enough to think
I mind his dangling after that Mrs. Halley!  She's
welcome to him!  Did he happen to say where Mr. Flood
had gone?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he had gone west to shoot things,"
Rosamund told her, and Cecilia became very thoughtful.
Later, while Rosamund was undressing, she
came into her room, and said,
</p>

<p>
"Rose, the Whartons have asked me to go on
their yacht to the Mediterranean.  If you are sure
you will not need me for a month or two I believe
I'll go."
</p>

<p>
They talked for a while of plans, with no mention
of Flood.  Rosamund had small difficulty in adding
the sum of two and two; it was plain enough that her
sister had accepted the hint of the defeat of any hopes
she might have had, and now was aiming somewhere
else; but Cecilia, in a blue negligée, her hair down
and her cheeks still delicately flushed, looking intently
at the toe of her silver slipper, was bewitchingly
pretty, and she had not the heart to laugh.  When
Rosamund announced her intention of leaving New
York next morning, Cecilia, in turn, ignored any
suspicions she might have had.  She even offered to keep
Yetta for a week, to take her to the master who was
to hear her voice, to find the suitable governess and
to send her back in the governess's charge before she
sailed.  She had taken a strange liking to the girl;
perhaps the adoration in the black eyes had something
to do with it.
</p>

<p>
Then, at last, Rosamund was alone.  Do we ever,
she wondered, look back upon our doubts and
misunderstandings, when once they are dissolved, with
anything but scorn and disgust for our own stupidity,
our blindness?  Pendleton's part in the affair was too
mean to be given a second thought.  Such people, she
supposed, there must be, content to feed upon the
crumbs of society, winning their way by their very
silliness, which amuses more by its vociferous
nonsense than by inherent wit.  She could dismiss him
as a meddler, knowing him too well to credit him
with worse intentions; he was not bad at heart, and
she knew that he would not have been merely spiteful
toward herself.  He had meant her no harm.  It
was her own part in it, and above all Ogilvie's, that
were hard to think about.  It was not for the woman
to move with courage high enough to overcome
misunderstandings; it was Ogilvie who had failed there.
He at least had known what Pendleton had said,
while she had been unaware of it.  After that hour
of wordless revelation, she asked herself, how could
he have doubted her?  In their walks and drives she
had been so sincerely herself with him, had given him
so many opportunities of knowing her character&mdash;even,
she blushingly told herself, of knowing her
heart.  Was it possible that any man, after that,
could so misunderstand her as to believe her capable
of such deception?  How could he have believed her
engaged to Flood?  Yet she realized that if he did
indeed believe it, he would not have pressed his own
claims.  Whatever his feeling for her, he would not
have tried to win her from the friend whom he placed
so high, whom he knew to be so worthy a man, for
whom he had told her that he would make any
sacrifice.  She was sorely wounded; yet there was that
quality in her blood which refused to be vanquished.  It
would have been natural enough to scorn him for his
doubt, to punish him for his neglect, to condemn him
for his lack of courage, when a word or two, scarcely
a question, would have made everything clear
between them.  To blame him, she told herself, would
be the easier way.  But her courage was higher than
that.  Beyond every other consideration, she knew
very well that she must give precedence to the love
that was in his heart and hers.
</p>

<p>
She recalled Mother Cary's words, "I reckon
there's a door o' distrust most of us has to pass
through, before we can stand in the land where there's
only content, an' love, an' trust."  Her heart warmed
anew to the wise, tender old woman whose wisdom
was large and loving enough to illumine every
shadow.
</p>

<p>
She fell asleep pondering upon it all, and carried
the same thoughts with her to the train next
morning.  She left New York before Yetta was awake,
having said farewell to a very drowsy and very
charming Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
It seemed strange that here the busy life of the
city could be rushing on, crowding and grinding and
shrieking, while there, in her mountains, as she knew
so well, only quiet stretches of snow and lines of black
pines and bare treetops, only the sun and the stars,
only the few slowly moving people, an old white mare
bringing home a tired man, the call of the man or boy
crossing the fields, the lowing of cattle from the
barnyards&mdash;only these made up the world!  Here every
second was crowded with activity; the deeper workings
of human hearts were drowned in noise.  There,
nothing ever hastened; life matured normally, like
the winter wheat; grew slowly, and to a largeness
impossible in the cities.
</p>

<p>
She had forgotten that the trains, in winter, were
less frequent.  She missed the last one, and had to
spend the night in Baltimore, and make a late start
the next morning.  She had been thinking, thinking,
during every waking moment since the hour of
Pendleton's disclosure, and in the station she bought an
armful of papers and magazines; even pictures of
criminals, financiers and actresses were better company
than her own thoughts!  There was no Pullman car
on the train in winter, and she welcomed the changing
company of the day-coach; but passengers happened
to be few, and she was soon forced to take up her
papers.
</p>

<p>
She was no exception among the women of her
sort; newspapers made uninteresting reading.  She
looked first with a slight distrust at the flaring headlines
on the front page, then turned to the social notes.
Those exhausted, an advertisement or two caught her
attention; and then there seemed to leap at her the
words: "TOBET FREE."  She read, almost at a
glance, the short paragraph which followed.
</p>

<p>
"The Federal authorities have failed to obtain
sufficient evidence to convict Joseph Tobet, of Long
Mountain, of the charge of illicitly distilling the
so-called 'White Lightning.'  Tobet had been under
suspicion for some months, and was arrested last
October, but the charge against him has been dismissed,
and the man was set at liberty yesterday."
</p>

<p>
The paper dropped to her feet.  She wondered
what effect this would have upon Grace, and
remembered the note of warning.  But, just from New York
as she was, such doubts or fears seemed too utterly
trivial to be of account.  Joe might threaten, Doctor
Ogilvie might shake his head, and Grace, poor soul,
might tremble; but the arm of the law was, after all,
a sure protection.  There was really nothing that
Joe could do; and she dismissed the thought of him
for the more welcome one of Ogilvie.
</p>

<p>
The day before, her impatience had been boundless.
She had not doubted that she should seek him
out at once, as the most courageous thing to do, tell
him what Pendleton had said, and of Flood's absence
in the West; that, she told herself, would surely
be enough.  He would then understand.
</p>

<p>
But to-day, as she drew nearer the end of her
journey, her resolution faltered.  He had been stupid;
his doubts had wronged her; his restraint, if such
it had been, was unfair to them both, and had stolen
something from their love which there would never
be time enough to replace.  It was not the woman's
part to offer apologies; it was the man's part to
have faith, or, at the very worst, to seek explanation.
If he could so deny himself, if her love was so small
a thing to him that he could bring himself to do
without it, was it for her to urge it upon him?
</p>

<p>
Her revulsion of feeling went still farther.  Life,
she told herself, was after all pretty much the same,
wherever it was lived.  To give happiness to Eleanor
and Tim, to care for Yetta&mdash;that was what had
justified her spending the winter in the mountains; she
could have done as much in town.  If she had not
found sincerity of purpose and singleness of aim
among her earlier friends, it was because she had not
learned to look for it.  She had only chosen the
easier part, not the higher; it was easier to be sincere
and simple in the mountains than in town where life
was more crowded.  It was she who had been at fault
in not finding in the old life what was more plainly
to be seen in the new; she was so small a creature that
she could not reach high purpose through confusing
interventions, but must have it laid before her in
bareness and singleness.  And what was, in truth, her
feeling for this man who could so readily doubt her, or,
at the very least of his offending, hold himself aloof
from her through any consideration whatever?  Aside
from his belief in her baseness, had he not been
willing to sacrifice her for his friend?  Would not love,
such love as she felt herself worthy of receiving, have
put aside without a thought of misgiving anything
and everything but the glory and necessity of its own
demands?
</p>

<p>
All the way her mind was busy with such problems
of its own making.  The journey seemed long.
She told herself that her impatience was only to end
it, to reassure herself by the sight of him; yet the
impatience was there.  It was mid-afternoon when she
alighted, remembering her last return.  She wondered
whether White Rosy would be there, and bent, on
her way down the car, to look along the platform.
</p>

<p>
But the only familiar form was the important
person who combined the functions of station master,
storekeeper and retailer of news.  He grinned when
he saw her, and came towards her with unusual alacrity.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I declare," he said, "got the news
a'ready, have ye?  Bad news sho'ly does travel
fast!"
</p>

<p>
She stood still and looked at him.  His eyes
brightened still more when he perceived that he was
to be the first to inform her.
</p>

<p>
"Why, ain't ye heard?" he cried.  "Yer house
was burnt down to the groun' las' night.  Thought
ye was in it, the doctor did.  That's how he so nigh
got killed."
</p>

XXI
</h3>

<p>
There are some hours of human experience so
intense with suffering that they return, again
and again, living themselves over in the memory,
arising in the small hours of the night&mdash;haunting specters
of pain, meeting us unexpectedly in an unguarded
moment of solitude to open and reopen the wounds they
have left, following us on through the years with a
recurring vindictiveness of pain almost as keen as
when it was first inflicted.  Joy, happiness, exaltation
of spirit, return only in new guises; they, too, make
their impression upon the memory, but otherwise.
The shock of loss, the agony of parting, the fear and
dread of the suffering of loved ones, the bitterness of
self-reproach, the message of loss&mdash;these are the
things that return and return again; and of such as
these were the hours of that afternoon to Rosamund.
Not only on that first night, once more in the small
upper room at Mother Cary's, but often and often
during her after life did the shock and agony of those
hours return to her.
</p>

<p>
Past the form of the station master, gloating in
his satisfaction at being the first to tell her the evil
news, she had seen Father Cary's familiar form
descending from his wagon.  She scarcely remarked his
surprise at her being there, his disappointment that
Doctor Blake and the nurse had not come on that
train, his helping her into the wagon, and his
description of the events of the night before.  The drive
past the dull little houses and the store, the closed
cottages, the big hotels with their uncurtained
windows staring like eyeless sockets, the woods, the
glimpses of the path where she had faced John
Ogilvie; the turn at last toward the brown cottage she
had come to love so dearly; the blackened, smoking
hole that alone remained of it; then the half mile
farther to the house where Ogilvie lay&mdash;those were
the moments of most intense pain, because of their
suspense.
</p>

<p>
The story was simple enough.  The little
household had gone to bed early, and toward midnight
Grace had awakened with a whispering fear of smoke.
She roused the others, and Eleanor had bundled
sleepy Tim in blankets, thrown other bed covering
out of a window, and gone quietly down with Grace.
Matt and Sue, wild with fear, rushed out ahead of
them, shouting, and their cries aroused the nearest
neighbors.  Country folk come quickly to a fire,
although there is seldom anything to do but watch and
surmise; a small crowd gathered in an incredibly
short time, and a few things were rescued from the
blazing house.  In spite of the pleading of the women,
Grace stayed to watch the flames, wringing her hands,
and calling Rosamund's name.  Eleanor was half
frantic herself, with the alternate efforts at calming
Timmy and beseeching Grace to go away.  But
Grace, loving and faithful, was crying at the loss of
the house and the things in it that had seemed to her
so beautiful, and that were so dear because they
belonged to Rosamund.  She could not be persuaded
to leave, but stood wringing her hands and saying,
over and over,
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Rose!  Oh, Miss Rose!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
&quot;A small crowd gathered in an incredibly short time.&quot;
</p>

<p>
After the first alarm, Aunt Sue became calm
enough to tell the questioners that all were safe, that
Miss Randall and Yetta were in New York.  But
the man who was urging White Rosy up the long
road from the valley, the man who, at last, came
running, stumbling, panting up to the little band of
watchers, who heard Grace Tobet calling a beloved
name and sobbing, did not wait for explanation.  He
looked among them for one face, and found it
missing; then he rushed into the blazing house.
</p>

<p>
There were brave men who, for the sake of all
he had done for their women and children, went after
him; there were strong arms to bear him to the nearest
shelter, and loving hands to tend him.  It was not
long before Mother Cary came, bundled up in the
wagon beside her big husband, to take command of
everything.
</p>

<p>
So short and simple a story of a ruin so great!
Rosamund sat dumbly in the kitchen of the little
house where Ogilvie lay, while Mother Cary told her,
braced beside her on the little padded crutch, her
tender old hands smoothing the girl's hair, the sweet
old voice speaking words of courage and hope.
</p>

<p>
"Pap's done telegraphed for Doctor Blake," she
said, "him that's his friend, him that sent Yetta up
here.  He's an eye doctor, but he'll know everything
to do for everything else as well.  We reckoned
he'd come on this train.  That's how come Pap was
there to meet it.  Howsomever, he'll be here before
the day's out, you mark me; an' he'll say jest what
I'm sayin'&mdash;John ain't goin' to die.  He's a goin'
to get well."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund looked up at her, and the old woman
understood.  "I wouldn't, ef I was you, darlin',
honey!  No, now don't ye go thinkin' that a way; it
ain't that he's burnt so bad, 'cause he ain't.  Hair
grows quick, an' that did get sco'ched a leetle mite.
I reckon all ails him is thet he breathed in the smoke."
</p>

<p>
Half-remembered tales of horror passed through
the girl's mind, and she hid her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, honey, ef you goin' to take on about
it, maybe you better jest come to the door and peek
in at him.  I guess when all's said an' done you got
more right than anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no," Rosamund cried, "no, I have not!"
</p>

<p>
But Mother Cary touched her cheek.  "Honey,
he wouldn't 'a' gone into the house that a way ef so
be it he hadn't 'a' thought all he loved best in the
world was there.  A body don't go into flames for
nothin'!  An' it wasn't no ways like the doctor to
lose his head&mdash;now was it?  You come right along
in here with yo' Ma Cary."
</p>

<p>
As long as she lived Rosamund could recall that
room&mdash;the dingy white walls, the oval braided rug
upon the floor; the tiny looking-glass and little
corner washstand; the bureau with its characteristic
assortment of shaving things, a stethoscope and a small
photograph in a plush frame of a woman dressed
in the fashion of thirty years before; the bedstead
of turned yellow wood, the bright patchwork quilt
over the feather-bed&mdash;and Ogilvie's form lying there,
his flushed face, his heavy breathing, his restless
hands.
</p>

<p>
The woman who was watching beside his bed
arose, and Rosamund crossed the narrow space.  She
bent over him a little, put out her hand, but shrank
back, restrained perhaps by the fear of an emotion
which threatened to be too strong for her.
</p>

<p>
She turned, went blindly from the little room, and
Pa Cary led her out to the wagon.  If he talked to
her on the way to his house she did not hear him.
Tim saw them coming, and ran to meet her.  The
pressure of his warm little arms about her neck, in
the "tight squeeze" that he usually reserved for
Eleanor, did more than anything else to bring her back
to a normal state of mind.
</p>

<p>
But after his first embrace, Tim wanted to go to
the stable with Father Cary.  Eleanor was standing
in the little familiar doorway, under the overhanging
roof made by the upper floor.  She waited, as if
spell-bound, while Rosamund walked slowly up the
path to the house; it was the look on the girl's face
that held her back, for her heart was reaching out in
sympathy.  At last Rosamund stood before her, and
they looked into each other's eyes; then Eleanor
opened her arms wide, and with a sob drew
Rosamund to her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my sweet, my Rose!" she cried, her tears
on Rosamund's cold cheek.  "I knew!  I knew!  I
knew it was John!  But he'll get well, darling.  He
will live for your sake!"
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund went past her into the house,
looked about the little familiar room as if she had
never seen it before, and seated herself in a chair near
the table.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor took off her hat and unfastened her coat
as if she had been a child, instead of the stricken
woman that she was; Rosamund looked up at her in
a dumb agony of appeal.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor repeated the story she had already heard
from Father Cary; at the end she paused, hesitated,
and said,
</p>

<p>
"But there is one thing more that you've got to
know, Rose.  The house was set on fire."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund looked up at her, as if waiting.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't look like that, my darling!  Try to
understand!  Someone set fire to the house&mdash;it's so
cruel to have to tell you!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Rosamund's face changed from its
blankness to a look of horror.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;had gone away, as he wanted me
to&mdash;Oh!  Eleanor, then he would not&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Eleanor's arms were around her.  "Don't,
Rosamund!  Don't let yourself do that!  There's not
one of us could live and be sane, if we dwelt on our
'ifs'!"
</p>

<p>
"But it is true!"
</p>

<p>
"It is not true.  It is not!  Because there was
no 'if'; there could not have been!  You had to
stay; you had to obey your own reasoning, not his.
We all have to decide for ourselves.  It is when we
don't, that we get into trouble.  I can assure you of
that, I of all others.  I married because I was told
it was the best thing to do&mdash;but you must forget I
told you that!"
</p>

<p>
At least it brought Rosamund to a thought of
something else.  "Eleanor!" she exclaimed, her
hand reaching out towards her friend.
</p>

<p>
But it was not the moment for Eleanor to think
of herself.  "Rose, listen to me," she said.  "Someone
set fire to the house.  There is no doubt of that.
Now you will have to make up your mind what to
do&mdash;there will have to be an inquiry, they say."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Because the people who look after
those things will want to find out who did it.  They
will want to fix the blame."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't understand!  It is my house!
What difference does it make to anyone else?"
</p>

<p>
"And you don't care?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund arose, and mercifully burst into tears.
"Oh, Eleanor!" she sobbed, "how can you ask me
that?  Do you think I care for the mere loss of a
few sticks and stones and things, when he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Again Eleanor's comforting arms were around
her, and Eleanor's hand on her hair.  "Oh, you
darling!  I knew you'd say that!  I knew you would!
They cannot do anything without your consent!"
</p>

<p>
Apparently in relief from some doubt or fear,
she even laughed.  Rosamund looked at her in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth do you mean?" she began.
</p>

<p>
But before there could be time for explanation
the door opened, and Father Cary brought his little
wife into the room in his arms, and set her down in a
chair.
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary always brought an atmosphere of
happiness with her, but this time, it seemed to Rosamund,
she was also the personification of all that was
angelic and beautiful, a messenger of hope, a bearer
of glad tidings.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she began, as soon as Pap had set her
down and unbundled her, "they come!  My, that
young woman knows jest how to go about things!  I
been nursin' all my life, seems like, and that girl
can't be more than twenty-five; but the way she took
a holt o' things did beat me!  My!  I wasn't one
bit worried at leavin' him with her, not one bit!  An'
Doctor Blake's goin' to set up all night."
</p>

<p>
She smiled into Rosamund's beseeching eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Blake says they ain't a doubt but he'll
be all right in no time!" she said, and mentally asked
forgiveness for stretching the truth.  "He says his
eyes ain't hurt a bit, far as he can tell, an' it's only
the smoke got into them, that's all.  An' anybody
knows that ain't much!  Land!  Think how many
smokin' chimblys there be, an' nobody givin' a
thought to 'em!"
</p>

<p>
It was not until after supper, when Tim had been
sent to bed, rather joyful than otherwise in his
excitement over the return to the Carys', and Eleanor
was trying to put him to sleep by telling him a story,
that Rosamund went upstairs to the room that had
been Yetta's, to be alone with her thoughts.  She was
never one of those, usually members of a large family,
who can take council with themselves while others
are in the room; she needed solitude, if she would
adjust herself and set the chambers of her mind in
order.  Now she had much to think of, for the events
of the past three days had been incongruous enough.
She smiled as she remembered that, scarcely forty-eight
hours before, she had been sitting in an opera
box listening to Pendleton's inanities; but there was
no smile when she thought of Ogilvie.
</p>

<p>
Presently she was aware, through the silence, of
a timid hand on the door.  She had scarcely had time
to do more than speak to Grace, who had sat, through
the earlier part of the evening, as if turned to stone;
now something told her she was there.
</p>

<p>
Grace, white and wan, came over the threshold
and threw her arms about her friend, resting her head
on Rosamund's shoulder.  For a few moments they
stood so, clasped in the sympathy that women convey
to each other in that silent manner.  Then Grace
released herself a little, looked into Rosamund's face,
and whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Rose, he did it!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund's thoughts had been of Ogilvie alone;
for a moment she did not understand.  Then Eleanor's
words came back to her; and all the while she
protested, she knew the truth of what Grace said.
</p>

<p>
But, out of pity, protest she must.  "Oh, no,
Grace!  No!  Don't think that!  Don't let
yourself think it!"
</p>

<p>
But Grace, even whiter than before, met her eyes
steadily.  "I don't have to think it," she said, quietly.
"I know it.  You know it, too."
</p>

<p>
At the agony in the poor creature's eyes Rosamund
forgot all her own.  "No," she cried, almost
aloud.  Their lowered voices in the silence of the
house seemed to add to the horror of it.  "No, I do
not know, and neither do you!  Don't say it, Grace.
Don't think it.  Grace!  Oh, my poor, dear Grace!"
</p>

<p>
But Grace shook her head impatiently, as if it
were not the time for sympathy.  She clasped Rosamund's
two hands, looked at her intently, and said,
"Miss Rose, I tell you I don't have to think; I
know!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund gasped, but Grace went on.  "I saw
him from my window, an' Rob Tobet and Nels' Dunn
were with him.  They were skulkin' in the shadow,
but I made 'em out.  It was the first time I'd seen
Joe, since&mdash;the first time, and to see him that a way!"
</p>

<p>
"Grace!" Rosamund cried.  Grace might have
held her hand in a flame, and seemed to suffer less.
Rosamund thought it was more than she could bear
to witness.  But Grace went on ruthlessly,
</p>

<p>
"They were watchin' and watchin' the house; an'
after a while I saw Joe wavin' his arms at the other
two, an' then they went off.  It wasn't very long after
that&mdash;maybe half an hour or so&mdash;that I smelled
smoke.  An', Miss Rose, when we got down an' out,
I saw what nobody else seemed to take any notice of&mdash;I
saw three corners of the house all blazin' up at
the same time."
</p>

<p>
Rosamund had drawn her down to the side of the
bed; now Grace paused, grasped Rosamund's hand,
bent towards her, and whispered, hoarsely,
</p>

<p>
"Miss Rose, houses don't catch on fire that a
way less'n somebody sets 'em!"
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other mutely for what
seemed an eternity, sharing and accepting the horrid
significance of it.  At last Rosamund, shaking off
the spell with a sharp indrawing of the breath, drew
Grace to her, held her, everything else forgotten save
that here was an agony greater than her own.
</p>

<p>
For a long hour they sat there talking, planning.
Grace was torn between her sense of righteousness
and her love for Joe, fanned anew as it was by his
present need of her protection.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I had stopped carin' for him," she
whispered.  "But this&mdash;this ain't like the&mdash;other
thing&mdash;you know what I mean.  That didn't hurt
anybody but himself, and it wasn't anybody else's
business, not the Gov'ment's nor anybody's.  But this
is different.  They&mdash;they hang for this, I reckon!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund shuddered.  "Grace, no one must
know of it!  No one must know!"
</p>

<p>
"I heard Pap Cary say they was to be an inquiry."
</p>

<p>
"It is my house.  I can stop anything of that sort.
I have no insurance on it, and there will be no one
to press the inquiry if I don't.  No one must know,
Grace."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Grace looked at her.  Then she
said, "But what if&mdash;<i>he</i> dies?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund had forgotten her own anxiety in
Grace's.  Now, with a little moan of pain, she hid
her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"That's the way," Grace whispered, hopelessly.
"You're bound to see it different, when it's your
own man."
</p>

<p>
They sat in silence for a while, each so occupied
with thoughts of her own love as to forget all else.
Presently Grace stood up, as if to admit that there
was nothing further to be said.  "Well," she sighed
hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
But Rosamund stood up, too, and laid her hands
on Grace's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"No matter what happens, Grace, nobody must
know that Joe was so much as seen near there."
</p>

<p>
"But supposin' Doctor Ogilvie&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Not even then," Rosamund said, with white,
trembling lips.  "He has given all his thought to
saving life.  Do you think he would want&mdash;?  No!"
</p>

<p>
But Grace shook her head.  "I think Mis'
Reeves suspicions," she said.
</p>

<p>
"She does," Rosamund said, "and she has already
been warning me against the investigation.  I
know she wants to shield Joe."
</p>

<p>
But Grace's conscience was made all the keener
by her reawakened love.  "Well, I'm goin' to tell
Ma Cary," she said.  "She knows more'n all of us
put together."
</p>

<p>
They stopped at Eleanor's door, and the three
found Mother Cary alone in the room that was
kitchen and dining-room and confessional, as need
arose.  Pap had gone back to the doctor's house, too
anxious to remain away.
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary heard all Grace had to tell, asked
a few questions of her and Eleanor, then sat with her
worn old hands clasped in her lap, thinking it over.
Grace's attitude was one of hopeless waiting.
Rosamund watched her, pitying; grief brings no
outward beauty to the lowly, she thought, yet
much&mdash;how much&mdash;of that beauty of soul which perishes
not!
</p>

<p>
At last Mother Cary spoke.  "Miss Rose is
right," she said, looking at Grace.  "Nobody must
know what we know 'ceptin' jest our own selves.  I
wouldn't even say a word of it to Pap; 'cause the
better men folks be, the more they hold on to the
letter o' the law.  An' fur as I can make out, this
here is one o' the times when the letter o' the law is
better forgotten.  Tellin' on Joe ain't goin' to help
Doctor Ogilvie any, that I can see, nor anybody else;
an' there's jest a chanct that keepin' silence may help
Joe."
</p>

<p>
"But Joe did it," Grace said.  "I reckon he's
man enough to take his punishment."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon he is," Mother Cary agreed.  "He's
a-takin' it right this minute, too, knowing what his
act has done to the doctor.  I sure do believe that's
all the punishmint Joe needs.  The other kind would
be different, 'cause what he's done is done.  I ain't
never had time to puzzle out the whys an' whyfors
o' lots o' things, punishmint among 'em; but one thing
I know, an' have known ever sence the dear Lord
entrusted me with little child'en o' my own.  When
punishmint is jest hittin' back, it don't do anybody
a mite o' good.  Less'n it helps 'em not to do it again,
it ain't any use whatsoever.  Better jest leave it in the
hands o' the dear Lord, Who sees further'n we can,
ef you ain't sure it's goin' to help, not hender.  An'
tellin' on Joe ain't goin' to help the doctor nor Joe
neither, 'cause Joe ain't the kind that punishmint
helps."
</p>

<p>
Again there was a silence, until Grace moved a
little, unclasped and clasped her hands, and spoke.
"I must go back to my own house," she said.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund, startled, was about to protest, but
Mother Cary nodded.  "Of course," she said, "he'll
be needin' you awful bad now, honey."
</p>

<p>
And in spite of Rosamund's pleading, Grace refused
Eleanor's offer to go with her, and took her
way, alone, through the night, down the mountain, to
her dark, lonely little house.  Afterward, Rosamund
often marveled at Mother Cary's allowing it, even
urging it, for usually she was the gentlest of souls,
protecting everyone, careful of everyone's comfort;
and surely Grace was now in no condition to go.
</p>

<p>
But no more than Grace herself did Mother Cary
hesitate.  She hobbled about the kitchen, packing a
little basket of food; she had Eleanor bring in one
of Pap's lanterns, and lighted it; she bade Rosamund
make Grace some tea, and forced the trembling creature
to drink it; and at last she opened the door for
her.
</p>

<p>
Grace started out, but came back into the room
to kiss them, and they saw that she was smiling; it
had been long since poor Grace had smiled!
</p>

<p>
"I'll go up to my chamber and wave the lantern
when I get there, ef all's well," she told them.  "An'
I can always see your light, Ma Cary!"
</p>

<p>
They watched, standing shivering in the doorway,
until her lantern disappeared at the bend of the road.
Tim, aroused by their voices, cried out, and Eleanor
went to him.
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary and Rosamund began to straighten
the room, putting away the boxes and pails that had
been opened for Grace's basket.  Rosamund was so
intent on her thoughts that she would not have
noticed that her own cheeks were wet, if she had
not seen Mother Cary's eyes brimming with tears.
After a while she cried,
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't see how she can walk that far, and
at night, too!  Why wouldn't you let her wait for Pa
Cary?"
</p>

<p>
The old woman shook her head.  "Honey," she
said, "ef all is as I make it out to be, Grace won't
go all that way alone and un'tended.  The woods
around here have years an' eyes, an' ef her foot
stumbles, there'll be someone there to hold her up, you
mark my words."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she is not strong enough!" the girl still
protested.
</p>

<p>
Then Mother Cary leaned towards her, took the
white hand in both her own, and asked, "Honey, ef
'twas <i>your</i> man, wouldn't <i>you</i> go?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund threw back her head with a sob, and
Mother Cary opened her arms.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
XXII
</h3>

<p>
Fortunately for Rosamund the succeeding
days were so busy that she had but little time to
be alone with her thoughts of Ogilvie.  The morning
after Grace's departure, Father Cary had come home
with disquieting news.  Pneumonia had set in; but
Doctor Blake would stay at the Summit until the
crisis was passed, and he had sent for another
nurse&mdash;the one who was at the head of his own private
hospital, Pap proudly told Rosamund in a pitying
attempt at reassuring her.
</p>

<p>
She had, first of all, to make some arrangement
for Yetta.  Cecilia rose to the occasion and found
the suitable governess, who proved to be an elderly
woman to whom Yetta took an immediate liking.
Miss Gates had been something of a singer in her
day, and she had a family of nieces and nephews that
she was helping to bring up, all of whom were musical.
She took Yetta with her to stay at their house
until other plans could be made.  Cecilia had,
indeed, shown energy and good judgment, and something
more; she sailed for the Mediterranean to join
the Whartons at Algiers only after she saw Yetta
installed in the Gates home&mdash;having been so good-natured
as to let the yacht go without her in order to
do so.
</p>

<p>
Matt and Aunt Sue were sent back to Georgia.
Secretly they were quite reconciled to going, for they
were to stop in Baltimore and replace their burned
wardrobes with entire new ones, with which they
looked forward to dazzling their friends in Augusta;
but Sue felt obliged to use the prerogative of the
negro servant to make a grumbling protest.
</p>

<p>
"I suttinly wouldn't 'a' journeyed 'way up to dis
yer Gord-fo'saken corner ob de yearth," she declared
to Rosamund, "whar dey ain't nothin' but a passel
o' Yankee white trash, ef I had 'a' known I was a
goin' to see my best Paisley shawl what Miss Lucy
done give me when she was ma'ied bu'nt up wid
flames befo' my ve'y eyes.  Et don' do nobody no
good traipsin' aroun' dis yer way, nohow.  You
better come along back home wid yer Aunt Susan, whar
you b'longs at, chile."
</p>

<p>
After they left, the routine of life was simple
enough; yet the days were laden with what anxiety,
what care, what fears, and trembling hopes!  Yet
living as she was on news from the doctor's house,
Rosamund was not altogether oblivious of what was
passing in the hearts of her friends.  She went every
morning to the Tobet cottage, sometimes with
Eleanor, sometimes alone.  For several days Grace
watched and waited for one who did not come.  But
at last Rosamund made a suggestion, which in a day
or two brought its return.
</p>

<p>
"You know the little boy who brought that note
to us at the brown house, last fall," she said to
Grace.  "Why not give him a note to Joe?"
</p>

<p>
"What to say?" Grace asked.
</p>

<p>
"That whatever happens, no one shall suspect
him.  Tell him you have my word, and Mother
Cary's, for that."
</p>

<p>
"I'd be afraid to write words like those," Grace
said.  "They might go to the wrong one&mdash;and then
no need to tell!"
</p>

<p>
"Then say them over to the boy, and make him
remember them," said Rosamund; and that was the
advice which Grace, in the desperate necessity of her
heart, followed.  A few mornings afterward, when
Rosamund came in sight of the cottage, Joe was
leaning against the door.  He went inside when he saw
her, and Rosamund turned back.  She told herself
that in Grace's place she would want no visitors for
a while.
</p>

<p>
But she had not gone far before Grace came
hastening after her.  She threw her arms about
Rosamund's neck.
</p>

<p>
"I got my man back," she whispered.  "I'm
prayin' every minute to the good Lord, Miss
Rose, that you'll get yours back, too, all safe an'
sound."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the secret of Eleanor's heart was not so readily
disclosed, although Rosamund suspected, from the
number of telegrams and letters that were coming,
and from Eleanor's frequent look of abstraction, that
she was beginning to have a good deal to think about.
But how far matters had progressed, she did not suspect;
for Eleanor's heart was troubled as it had never
been, and she would not add to Rosamund's burden
of care by confiding her own.
</p>

<p>
That she was suffering could not escape the keen
eyes of Mother Cary, however.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't you troubled about somethin', dearie?"
the old woman asked, one day when Rosamund and
Tim were out of doors, and dinner was cooking, and
they two were alone.
</p>

<p>
Eleanor looked at her dumbly; a quiver passed
over her face, seeming to leave it whiter than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Land!" said Mother Cary.  "Don't look that
a way, honey!  No wonder little Timmy used to call
you 'White Lady'!"
</p>

<p>
She seated herself in the little chair with the legs
that Father Cary had sawed off to suit her, and drew
another up beside it.
</p>

<p>
"Now you come set down here by your Ma Cary,
lamb, an' tell me what's the matter."
</p>

<p>
Eleanor seated herself, and put her hand on the
old woman's lap.
</p>

<p>
"I am in trouble, Mother Cary," she said.  "But
it cannot do any good to talk about it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it cert'n'y don't do one mite o' good to
let it eat in, dearie.  It don't make you die any
sooner, much as you'd like to sometimes, when trouble is
real bad; it don't make you forget; nor it don't show
you any way out.  It jest makes the way seem
longer."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," Eleanor said.  Then she pondered
for a while.  Presently she asked, "Do you
remember Mr. Flood, Mother Cary?"
</p>

<p>
"The rich gentleman that run over Timmy?
Yes, lamb, I always remember them I like."
</p>

<p>
Eleanor smiled.  "He did run over Timmy,
didn't he?  Or run into him!  So indirectly I owe
him my precious baby!"
</p>

<p>
"And now he wants you to pay him?" the old
woman asked.
</p>

<p>
"Put it that way!" Eleanor replied.  "But I
cannot pay him, Mother Cary&mdash;not as he wants me
to!  I&mdash;I may become blind, some day."
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary's hand tightened over hers.  "Ain't
your poor eyes any better?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Oh, yes, they are better.  But I am
afraid.  Think of burdening a man with a blind wife!
And&mdash;and he is such a splendid man, Mother Cary!
He deserves the very best."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't doubtin' it.  He's John Ogilvie's friend,
and that's enough to satisfy me that he's worth a
good deal."
</p>

<p>
They sat in silence for a while; then Mother
Cary said, "Darlin', I'm a-goin' to tell you a little
story.  I ain't takin' it on me to advise you; but I
jest want to tell you how, though you wouldn't guess
it, maybe, I was once in the same kind of a shadder
you be in now."
</p>

<p>
"Do tell me," Eleanor said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, when I was a little girl, lamb, I fell an'
hurt my back, an' when I got better, two or three
years afterward, I couldn't do nothin' but scrabble
aroun', not even as good as I can now.  An' I growed
all crooked.  It didn't make much difference for a
while, I was that glad to be movin' at all.  But as
I growed up an' the other girls began to go places,
an' I couldn't an' wasn't asked to, it did seem to me
I jest couldn't live at all.  There wasn't anythin' to
look for'ard to.  Then my father died, an' I went
into the tin shop.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't nice work, an' the big machines like
to scared me to death at first, 'n I got cut, 'n once one
o' the girls near me got some of her fingers cut off.
In winter I had to go before light in the mornin' an'
stay workin' till long after dark.  Then I had sech
a cough, an' one spring I had to quit work.  The
doctor, he asked me if I hadn't any kin in the country,
an' I not knowin' what he was aimin' at told him
I didn't know o' none 'xcept Ma's own aunt 't I'd
never seen nor wrote to.
</p>

<p>
"Unbeknownst to me the doctor he wrote up here
an' found out 't Aunt Marthy was a-keepin' house
for her husband's nephew, an' she wrote back 't I was
to come up an' spend the summer in the mountains.
I cried at first, for I hadn't ever seen the country an'
I didn't know Aunt Marthy, an' I was jest afeared
to come.  But the doctor he put me on the train, an'
when I got to the station over there it was most
dark&mdash;'bout as dark as it is now, I guess.  There was
a man on the platform, 'n I thought he was the biggest
man I'd ever seen.  When he come up to me he
said, 'Why, you <i>are</i> a little mite!  Guess they
haven't been feedin' you much where you come from.'  He
had a big quilt in the wagon, an' he jest wrapped
me all up in it an' lifted me in like I was a baby.
I was that tired an' scared, an' I hadn't ever been
taken keer of before, an' I jest up an' cried.  He
didn't ask me what was the matter, but he jest
laughed at me an' made fun o' me, an' said if I acted
like a baby he'd treat me like one, 'n he patted my
hand, 'n tucked me all up, 'n talked to me all the
way home.  When Aunt Marthy met us at the door
an' he carried me in the house in his arms, he said
to her, 'Well, now, Aunt Marthy,' he said, 'we've
jest got a baby to keer for, an' I'm a-goin' to help you
do it.'  An', honey, there hasn't been a day sence
then that he hasn't taken keer o' me.
</p>

<p>
"There never was a summer like that one; seems
like I never had been alive before.  I never knew
before how spring come, but I found out that year, Jim
showin' me the first bluebirds an' bringin' in flowers.
I jest thought he was next to God A'mighty, honey,
an' I never once give a thought to me bein' a woman
an' he bein' a man.  I hadn't never had none o' the
good times girls have, an' I guess I had come to
forget I was a girl.  By the time end o' summer come,
Jim had gotten in the way o' carryin' me out with
him everywheres, out to the barn, out to the wood-lot,
out to the fields where he was a-workin'.  I had
grown strong enough to get aroun' like I do now,
but Jim jest carried me 'roun' like he'd done that
first night, an' Aunt Marthy 'n he wouldn't let me
do a mite o' work.
</p>

<p>
"Then, when I'd got real well, I said somethin'
one night about goin' back to the factory.  We was
at supper, an' Jim he jest put down his knife an'
looked at me a minute.  Aunt Marthy reached over
an' put her hand over his, an' then he got up an'
went out.  I was that scared, not knowin' what I'd
done, an' Aunt Marthy told me I'd better go out an'
find him.
</p>

<p>
"So I up an' followed him, an' he was a-standin'
outside, lookin' so big against that yaller sky, an'
straight an' tall with his arms folded on his chest,
a-frownin', with his lips drawn in like he does when
somethin's upset him right smart.
</p>

<p>
"I touched him on the arm an' said, 'Jim!' an'
with that he turned him right aroun' quick.
</p>

<p>
"An' then, after a bit, he set me down an' held
on to my hands, an' told me how he wasn't goin' to
let me go back to the city any more, 'n how it was
goin' to be.  I told him I wasn't fit for him, bein'
crooked, an' he jest laughed at me an' fixed it all his
way, 'n called Aunt Marthy out 'n told her.  She
laughed at him an' told him he was more of a baby
'n I ever was.  He always was that bright an' willful,
an' he didn't give me a chance to say anything.
But the more he talked, the more I found I loved
him, an' the more I loved him the harder I made up
my mind 't he shouldn't tie himself to a cripple.
</p>

<p>
"So that night when they was asleep, I got up
an' took the money I had for my ticket home, an' I
started to walk to the station.  You know how far
that is.  By time mornin' come I wasn't halfway.  I
went into an old barn an' hid all day.  I heard 'em
callin' me, an' I saw Jim go by on horseback, an'
other men, too, huntin' for me.
</p>

<p>
"Lat the nex' night I started for the station
again, an' I got there jest about daybreak, thinkin'
I'd be in time for the early mornin' train.  When I
got up on the platform, there was Jim a-waitin'!
Course I jest set right down an' cried, but Jim he
made me understand what he'd been through while
I was hid, an' talked to me so right then and there
that I never once after that doubted in my mind but
what it would be right for me to marry him.  An'
honey, I haven't ever had reason to doubt it since.
I scarcely ever remember bein' a cripple, 'xcept when
I do get good an' mad sometimes at not bein' able
to get aroun' as spry as other folks.  Sometimes I
think it's been a real comfort to Jim, an' better 't I
was so.
</p>

<p>
"There's some folks as can't be happy 'nless
they're doin' for somebody else; an' when it happens
to be a man, an' he can do for what's his own, he's
boun' to be a good deal better off than ef he had to
go a-huntin' for somethin' to take up his mind.  It
grows on 'em, too.  I don't ever regret bein' a cripple;
my bein' helpless has been sech an occupation for Jim!"
</p>

<p>
The door had opened while she was saying the
last words, and Timmy burst in, joyous and cold, to
climb into Eleanor's lap and begin to pour forth an
account of the mild adventures of his walk.  But
Eleanor, taking off his coat and leggings, hushed him.
Mother Cary looked up at Rosamund and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"So you and Timmy had a fine walk, did ye?
Well, I'm real glad.  It'll do you good to get out,
honey-bud.  I was jest tellin' Mis' Reeves how-come
Pap and me got married!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' to get married to my muvver when
I grows up," said Tim.
</p>

<p>
Rosamund smiled back at Mother Cary; but her
smiles had lost their old merriment.  The old woman
went on:
</p>

<p>
"I was jest a-sayin' how Pap built this house
for me jest like I wanted it, an' we come into it when
we were married.  Aunt Marthy lived here with us
tell she died.  Pap's made my flower beds every
spring, an' I've planted the seeds.  Seems like it's
been that a way in everything.  Pap does most o' the
work, but I never get a chance to forget how glad
he is 't I'm here.  Whensoever he comes in all worned
out, he always knows where to find me, me not bein'
able to get far away; 'n I've never seen the time 't
he didn't feel fresh an' strong again after he'd set
an' talked a spell, an' had a bite o' somethin' I'd fixed
for him.  I ain't never been afeared to show him
how much I loved him.  When the children was little
'an toddlin' aroun', they'd run to meet him an' hang
aroun' him, but he always looked over their heads
to me first.  When John was married an' went away,
an' I felt so bad, Pap jest used to laugh at me; an'
when Lizzie got married, too, an' went off with her
husband, Pap jest said he'd have me all to himself
again.  The time when the child'en were little was
best to me, but I know the best time to Pap is
whenever he can find somethin' to be a-doin' for me."
</p>

<p>
The sweetness of her words seemed to fall on
them all like a blessing; for a while no one spoke;
but to Rosamund, watching Eleanor, it seemed as if
the lovely face were slowly melting from its usual
sadness to a rosy glow.  As she looked, Eleanor put
the child down from her lap and knelt before Rosamund.
</p>

<p>
"Rose, my sweet," she said, her voice a song of
love and tenderness, "would you think me deserting
you, if I went to New York to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund half divined something of her meaning;
she took Eleanor's face between her palms, looking
into the eyes that were glowing as she had never
seen them.
</p>

<p>
"Eleanor!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary gave a low laugh of delight.
"Here, Timmy," she said, "you come with Ma Cary
an' see what I got in the pantry!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
XXIII
</h3>

<p>
During the first week of Ogilvie's illness
Rosamund went once or twice to the house at the
Summit where he lay.  Doctor Blake had heard the
story of the fire, and in the deliberate courtesy of his
manner Rosamund suspected a veiled distrust; she
imagined that he was wondering, whenever he looked at
her, what manner of woman it was for whom Ogilvie
had risked his life, and whether she were worthy of his
possible sacrifice.  She told herself that she would have
felt the same, in his place; while, in her humility, she
secretly reiterated her own unworthiness.  But she
knew herself guiltless of actual blame or wrong-doing,
and found it hard to endure Doctor Blake's scrutiny,
which seemed both to accuse and weigh and find
wanting.  Yet even that was easier to bear than the
tolerant manner of the young woman in the white
dress and coquettish cap, who came out of Ogilvie's
room to assure her, with the tolerant air that seems
to be an attribute of street-car conductors, policemen
and trained nurses, that there was really no immediate
prospect of change in the patient's condition, as
pneumonia had to run its definite course.
</p>

<p>
For all the longing of her heart, and for all the
courage with which she started out, Rosamund
allowed herself to be snubbed into retreat.  Mother
Cary alone braved the authoritative one whenever she
pleased, or whenever Pap would take her across the
valley; and it was on the ninth night after the fire
that she did what Rosamund and Ogilvie always
declared to be the most merciful and courageous act
of all her beautiful life.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she said, after supper, when Pap had
gone out to the barn to harness the horse for his
nightly pilgrimage, "Now, honey, this bein' the
night when he'll come to, or&mdash;when he'll come to,
surely&mdash;don't you think he ain't goin' to come to,
'cause he is&mdash;and you're goin' over with Pap to be there!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund rose from her place beside the table,
her hands clasped against her heart, pale, then
flushed, then pale again.
</p>

<p>
Mother Cary looked up at her.  "Darlin', come
here to yo' Ma Cary," she said, and, when the girl
knelt beside her, she put her arms about her and laid
her withered, soft old cheek against Rosamund's hair.
</p>

<p>
"Honey," she said, "Ma Cary knows how you're
feelin'!  You're a young maid, an' by words unasked;
but he's your man, an' you're his woman, in the sight
o' God and the knowledge o' your own hearts.  Ain't
it so?  Yes&mdash;but don't cry, my lamb!  Don't cry like
that!  This ain't the time to cry.  Look at me, dearie!
That's right!  Well, I didn't tell you to go, before
to-night, because I knew 'twasn't for the best; but
now your place is over there, alongside o' him.  Let
him open his eyes on you, ef so be it he is to open
them knowin'ly in this world again.  An' ef he ain't
to be permitted to do that&mdash;then, my lamb, it's for
you to be there to close 'em.  There!  That's right!
Put it all back&mdash;grief keeps, an' maybe you won't
need it, after all.  Sho'!  Hyear me talkin'!  Why,
I jest downright know you won't need it!"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund lifted her white, white face.
"But&mdash;&mdash;" she began.
</p>

<p>
"I know what you're thinkin'," Mother Cary
said.  "I once thought that a way, too, befo' Pap
made me see what was right.  Put all sech doubts
away from you.  Your love an' his love are worth
more than that.  Look Ma Cary in the face, lamb,
an' tell me&mdash;ain't they?  There, there, now don't
let the tears rise up again.  You ain't got time for
tears to-night."
</p>

<p>
"But the nurse&mdash;Doctor Blake&mdash;what will they&mdash;Oh,
how can I?"
</p>

<p>
"It'll be all right with Doctor Blake.  He knows
you're comin'!  An' as for the nurse, she's a paid
hirelin', and you're his woman.  Jest you bear that
in mind, honey&mdash;hurry, there's Pap's wheels!"
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass, in that critical hour before
dawn when souls so often waver upon the threshold
of life, when John Ogilvie's breathing became less
labored and his eyes opened&mdash;tired, to be sure, but
with unmistakable consciousness in them&mdash;it was
Rosamund who was bending over him, while the
strange woman in the white gown and cap looked at
him, felt his pulse, smiled as if satisfied, and went out
and closed the door behind her.  It was Rosamund
whose eyes smiled into his with the pitiful, brave
effort of trying to make believe that there had never
been any danger at all to frighten her.  His hand
moved toward her, his lips formed her name; and it
was Rosamund's warm palm which closed over his
hand, and her cheek which rested against his as he
went to sleep.
</p>

<h3>
XXIV
</h3>

<p>
It was late April, and the snow was gone from the
mountains save in a few sheltered places under
some rock or overhanging tangle of roots.  In the
valley the apple trees were abloom; in the woods the
dogwood was falling; the roadsides were turning
from mellow brown to green, here and there
carpeted with violets; a line of emerald showed where
some willows caressed the stream.  Great puffs of
cloud floated slowly across the deep blue of the sky,
their cool shadows passing reluctantly over the plowed
fields, the few bright patches of wheat, and the brown
ribbon of road&mdash;gray in summer and lately white
with snow&mdash;that wound up from the lowland.  Even
the weather-worn buildings bore signs of spring.
Barn doors were thrown back, and little calves tied
in the barn yards protested their infant loneliness;
while from upper windows of the houses, windows
that had been kept closed during all the long winter,
flapping curtains waved outward to the breeze.
</p>

<p>
Two months and more had passed since the night
when John Ogilvie returned to consciousness to find
the face he loved bending above him, and on this
particular morning Father Cary had driven Rosamund
to the post office at the Summit, on his way to sell a
calf, and she was taking a leisurely homeward way,
reading, as she went, the handful of letters the mail
had brought her.  Every now and then the betraying
fragrance of arbutus lured her from the road to little
excursions among the trees.  Sometimes she looked
up at the flash of a brilliant wing, or stopped to listen
to an outburst of bird-music.  It was plain to be seen
that she was living in the hour; the present satisfied;
she was taking it as unquestioningly as a child, caring
neither to hasten its passing nor to hold it back.  To
past and future she was giving no thought; the moment
was enough.
</p>

<p>
She smiled often over her letters.
</p>

<p>
Yetta's was a pæon of joy.  She had been for
two months under the care of the governess chosen
by Mrs. Maxwell, working hard at all her lessons,
devouring them, Rosamund thought&mdash;and going
twice a week to an advanced pupil of a great master
for singing lessons.  She wrote that she had just
received a letter from Mrs. Flood, saying that when
the master declared her ready to study in Paris or
Berlin, she would make it possible for her to go.
"How funny it seems," she wrote, "to call dear
Mrs. Reeves by that name!"
</p>

<p>
There was a long envelope from an architect,
enclosing various blue-prints which she tried to unfold,
but which so resisted the breeze that they were soon
put back for later inspection.  There was a thin letter
from Cecilia, bearing a foreign stamp, which Rosamund
read more than once, with varying emotions.
It ran:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
DEAR ROSAMUND:
</p>

<p>
Your letter has made me very happy.  I had no
right to expect anything from Colonel Randall's will,
although he was always so good to me that I thought
of him as a father.  But I was hurt, and it would be
foolish not to admit that I was disappointed, when I
found that he had left me nothing.  So was mamma;
it was not easy for us to be dependent upon you.  I
don't mean to hurt you in saying that.  Especially
now!  Because, Rose, dear, you have made me see
that my stepfather was right when he left everything
to you.  He could trust you!
</p>

<p>
You have really been magnificent.  Your gift&mdash;for
that is what it is&mdash;will make the world a different
place for me.  I had to go to bed for two days after
I got your letter.  I was overcome!
</p>

<p>
Now I do hope you won't be too much surprised,
dear, and I don't want you to disapprove.  I suppose
you know that Mr. Flood sent over his yacht, the
Esperanza, so that it would be ready for Kiel.  But
perhaps you don't know that he told Marshall to
make use of it until he wanted it himself.  Well, he
did; it was nice of him, wasn't it?  So Marshall
brought it to Algiers, and the Whartons&mdash;and I&mdash;saw
a good deal of him.  It is all over now, so I
may as well confess that Marshall and I were very
unhappy for a time.  We didn't have five thousand a
year between us!  But when I got your letter, and
the papers&mdash;and the note from the bank&mdash;oh,
Rosamund, you will never, never know how the world
changed for me.  And we were married yesterday, at
the American Consulate in Lisbon, and I am your
happy, happy, happy sister,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
CECILIA PENDLETON.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Rosamund held the letter to her heart, when she
had read it; it was all just as she had hoped.  She
wondered what Ogilvie would say&mdash;but that could
wait!
</p>

<p>
The last letter was in Eleanor's handwriting.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
MY OWN DEAR ROSE:
</p>

<p>
Your letter told me nothing that I was not
prepared for.  But I don't know how to put into words
even a small part of my hopes for you.  John
is&mdash;excepting my own dear husband&mdash;the best man in the
world.  You will be happy, and proud, as I am happy
and proud; we both send our love, and wish we might
be with you on that beautiful morning that is coming
so soon.  But we cannot, for almost as soon as we get
back to New York from this lovely Columbia Valley
we shall have to sail for Europe.  So we can only
send our love, my darling; and Timmy is sending
something else by express.
</p>

<p>
I am so happy that I cannot help wondering
whether this is really myself; yet ever and always,
sweet, I know that I am I&mdash;YOUR ELEANOR.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Rosamund had kept that letter to read last; and
as she folded it back into its envelope there were
tears in her eyes, so that for a moment she did not
see the familiar figure of a white horse, that was
coming upon her with the gentle ambling trot that White
Rosy fell into when her master was in one of his
absent-minded moods.  It was a sort of up-and-downness
of a trot, one of Rosy's great achievements.
Ogilvie always said that it was worthy of everyone's
admiration, since it made a remarkably good effect
with the minimum of effort.
</p>

<p>
When she had come up to the place where Rosamund
waited, White Rosy stopped of her own accord,
edged toward the side of the road, and began to
nibble at the young green things already burgeoning
there.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie looked, without speaking, at the girl
waiting for him at the roadside.  She was not
smiling, yet her whole look seemed a smile.  She was
standing with her chin uplifted, her eyelids a little
drooped; he thought she was the most beautiful thing
in all the beauty of the spring-kissed world.
</p>

<p>
"Don't move!" he said.  "I just want to look
at you!"
</p>

<p>
Then slowly the smile came.  She turned her
head away to look at him roguishly, sideways.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you want?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No!" he cried, explosively; and with a little
bubbling laugh she sprang up to the empty place at
his side, and turned her face towards him.
</p>

<p>
Presently he asked, looking off to the mountain
with a very casual air.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Grace to-day?"
</p>

<p>
Rosamund looked at him anxiously.  "Not to-day!
Isn't she well?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I thought you might like to see her.  I'm
on my way there now," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you remember," she asked, "the first
day you took me there?"
</p>

<p>
"Do I remember?" he repeated.  "I remember
a good many things."
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease&mdash;be serious!  Do you remember,
that was the first of all our drives together, and this
is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, not quite the last, I hope!"
</p>

<p>
"No!  But&mdash;the last&mdash;until there will be a difference!"
</p>

<p>
"It's a difference I welcome, sweet!" he declared;
and at the look in his eyes she put up her
hands to ward him away.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  Not now!" she said, in one of the
sudden shy reserves that he adored, for all their
tormenting him.  "I want to tell you about my letters."
</p>

<p>
He read them, smiling with her over each one;
but there was no time for comment then, for they
were stopping before the Tobets' house, and White
Rosy was looking inquiringly around at them.
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie led the way into the cottage.  It seemed
strangely quiet.  Joe came from the inner room,
grinned at them in a friendly way, and Ogilvie
motioned to Rosamund to go in.
</p>

<p>
The quiet, the presence of Joe at that time of
day, something in the doctor's manner, all made her
pause; Ogilvie held the door open for her, but he
was looking at Joe as men look when they understand
each other.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  What is it?" Rosamund breathed, and
he turned to her, still smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Go in," he said.  "It's the loveliest sight in
God's world, isn't it, Joe?"
</p>

<p>
The smile left Joe's face, but not his eyes.  "It
be," he agreed, emphatically, and began very
vigorously to rattle the stove.
</p>

<p>
Within the darkened room Grace lay; and although
the little place was decked with its gayest of
quilt and curtain, although Grace's face shone with a
radiance as of heaven itself, Rosamund saw only the
wee brown head in the hollow of her arm.
</p>

<p>
She went slowly forward, awed in the presence
of the newly awakened soul in such a tiny form.
Grace smiled up at her.
</p>

<p>
"Joe says he's that glad he favors me!" she
whispered, and nestled her cheek against the downy
head.
</p>

<p>
Such simple words, and so momentous an event!
Just humble pride that the father of her child
rejoiced in his son's likeness to his mother!  A cheek
against a baby's forehead, an old agony forgotten!
The master-marvel of all creation sleeping upon the
breast so lately wrung in torture!  Such innocence,
such purity, blessing and cleansing the house of all
sin and sorrow, of shame and bitterness!  God's
breath in the new life, His ever recurring purpose
of Love redeeming!
</p>

<p>
Rosamund could find no fitting words before the
miracle.  The joyous words of an ancient song echoed
in her heart, "Mine eyes have seen Thy Salvation!"
</p>

<p>
But she was far from ready for her own <i>Nunc
Dimittis</i>.  The future drew her, life was welcoming
her to its fulfillment.  She kissed the pale, smiling
mother, went swiftly from the room, past the two
men whom she saw through a blur of tears, and out
to the road where spring was waiting.
</p>

<p>
There, presently, Ogilvie joined her.  Her look
deeply stirred him.  Her eyes were darker than he
had ever seen them, darker than he thought they
could be&mdash;or was it, he wondered, that he lost the
sense of their color in sounding the promise that
welled up from their depths?  The promise he read
there was a reflection of the revelation of those
moments in Grace's room.  So might Mary's eyes have
looked when she bowed before the angel.  For a
moment they looked silently at each other; then, with
a little sobbing indrawn breath, she withdrew her
gaze and he took his place beside her.
</p>

<p>
He urged White Rosy's reluctant feet toward a
rough wood-road that led up the mountain.  For a
while neither spoke.  The air was full of little fitful
pauses and quickly blown breaths of fragrance.  A
white petal fluttered from somewhere and caught,
trembling, in her hair.  A bee passed so near their
faces, in his eager quest for sweetness, that they drew
quickly back.  Against the blue of the sky a hawk
circled slowly, with no visible motion of pinion,
seeking in vain in the unfolding life of earth for
something dead to feast upon.  The woods were hushed,
and from their moist recesses faint vapors rose,
wraithlike spirits of departing winter, and melted off
in the warm sweetness of the air.
</p>

<p>
After a while they came to an open space, the
scar of some old fire, from which they could look
across the great plain below, back toward the
Summit and the blackened spot that had been Rosamund's
cherished home a few weeks before, and down upon
the roof of the little house that sheltered Grace and
her baby.  White Rosy stopped, looked down at the
faint green of the fields and whinnied; then she took
up her roadside feasting.  "See that bluebird,"
Ogilvie presently said, pointing.  "See the blue flash
of his wing!  See&mdash;ah, there's his mate!"
</p>

<p>
They watched the flight of the bird until his mate
had lured him out of sight.  Then Ogilvie turned to
her.  "Rosamund," he said, "I have something to
tell you&mdash;something to ask."
</p>

<p>
She smiled at him.  "Something more?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there will always be something more!
There always is&mdash;human love being not only human!
But&mdash;I have had an offer of a professorship&mdash;a new
chair that has lately been given in the University of
the North."
</p>

<p>
He paused, as if waiting for a question from her;
but she said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"You will go with me?"  It was scarcely a question;
she smiled, remembering how he always took
for granted that she would do his will.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she said, quietly.
</p>

<p>
"It would mean great things for me," he went
on, as one reading from an open page.  "The university,
the quickening life there; the unlimited power
to search out; everything to work with, and
then&mdash;success, success and&mdash;fame!"
</p>

<p>
He paused, and drew a deep breath or two before
he went on.  When he spoke again a new quality
had come into his voice.
</p>

<p>
"But what if I do not go?  What if I give it
up?  What if I stay here?"
</p>

<p>
He turned to her now, his eyes burning with his
question; for, this time, question indeed it was, and
not the old demand.
</p>

<p>
"Will you stay with me?"
</p>

<p>
Her look grew softer, holding almost the reassuring
sweetness of a mother.  It was as if she wished
to smile away his doubt.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she said, again.
</p>

<p>
She had long since come to know that he was the
least given to expressing his feelings when they were
most deeply stirred.  The very intensity of his
emotion seemed to bind him.  Now he looked at her, and
he flushed very deeply; yet still he made no move to
embrace her.
</p>

<p>
"You are made for the highest and best, Rosamund.
I am offering you only the commonplace!"
</p>

<p>
She looked off over the valley with unseeing eyes.
She, too, had her vision.
</p>

<p>
"'Only the commonplace!'  What is that, John?
Is it life, and love, and service?"
</p>

<p>
"It may be," he said, and drew her to him.
</p>

<p>
She felt for his hand, and let her own creep under
its warmth.  Together they looked again at the
familiar scene before them, colored now with their
own dreams.  Presently, recalling something of an
earlier time, she said.
</p>

<p>
"It's the land of content, John!"
</p>

<p>
He repeated the words, as if their music, but half
understood, sounded sweet in his ears.  "The land of
content?"
</p>

<p>
"They are Mother Cary's words," she told him.
"Aren't they like her&mdash;so quaint and true, and so
wise!  She told me once that we must all know doubt
and pain and sorrow, if we would cross the threshold
of happiness, into the land of content."
</p>

<p>
He said nothing; but she knew from his look that
he was sharing her vision.
</p>

<p>
"Cecilia&mdash;Eleanor&mdash;they think they know it,
too, I suppose&mdash;poor dears!"
</p>

<p>
Ogilvie threw back his head and laughed.  Then
he looked at her with a smile in his eyes&mdash;the smile,
half tenderness and half pity, that we give to a
beloved child who thinks he has just discovered a new
truth.
</p>

<p>
"And you are the only one who knows anything
about it?" he teased.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you, too!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!  I'm glad you let me in!"  But he
grew serious again.  "Do you know," he said, "I
have a suspicion that your land of content is
wherever love is?"
</p>

<p>
She brushed his shoulder with her cheek.  "I
shouldn't wonder!" she said.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But White Rosy was not interested in such
speculation.  Evidently having decided that dinner was
more to be desired than the view, she set off down
the road, at her briskest trot, toward the valley.
They laughed; but neither would have thought of
restraining White Rosy when she had taken the
control of affairs upon herself.
</p>

<p>
"But I hate to come down from the high places,"
Ogilvie protested.  "She's an old tyrant, a materialist!"
</p>

<p>
He had brought from the intensity of his emotions
all a lover's clamoring to prolong the hour alone
with the beloved.  His visions now went no farther
than the sweet reality beside him.
</p>

<p>
She laughed back at him.  "I'm not going to let
you offend her, though; I want to keep her always
on my side.  And we can take our high places with
us!"
</p>

<p>
That turned him serious again for the moment.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure," he asked her, "that you can be
satisfied to remain here?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, or anywhere&mdash;&mdash;"  She paused, and he,
reassured, smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," he urged.  "Go on!  You were going
to say something very nice to me!  I want to hear it!"
</p>

<p>
But she looked curiously embarrassed.  "I&mdash;I
was not going to say anything of the kind!  I was
thinking of&mdash;something!"
</p>

<p>
Then she took her courage firmly in hand.
"John," she said, "did you guess that&mdash;that it was
I&mdash;who&mdash;gave that professorship?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes opened wide.  "Why, no!" he said.
"Did you?  Well, now, I think that was a very
good thing to do!  How did you happen to think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;it was a sort of thank-offering&mdash;and a sort
of experiment."
</p>

<p>
He looked around at her.  "Oh!  It was!  Well,
don't you try any more of your experiments on me!"
</p>

<p>
"John&mdash;have you known, all along, about&mdash;about
my horrid money?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her quizzically.  "Well&mdash;yes.  I
knew.  Oh, I knew, of course!  But&mdash;it isn't one of
the things that counts, is it?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her, sure of her agreeing.  She drew
a long breath.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "it doesn't seem to be one of
the things that count."
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be no further need for words;
neither spoke again until White Rosy stopped before
Mother Cary's gate.  Then Rosamund turned her
face toward Ogilvie.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow!" she said.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p334"></a>
His lips trembled.  "To-morrow," he replied,
"and all the to-morrows!"
</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
